<h2>Preface</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the days of sail, the duties of
masters, mates, and crews, were well defined. Sea practice, in the
various rigs, had become standard with the authority of an ancient
calling.</p>

<p>The art of sailing, and of rigging ships, was a precise
matter. Gear remained standard for a century. The main
to'bowline of a Black Ball Liner, tearing to windward in
a North Atlantic hummer, was rove and led in much the
same fashion as the main to'bowline of the ships of Nelson
and Van Tromp. And the old time seamen, in their usage
and habits, followed the regularity of the ships upon which
they sailed.</p>

<p>The gradual transition from sail to steam carried with
it, for a time, the old system of sailing ship routine. But
to-day the sailing ship sailor is a thing of the past; the works
of steam and steel are upon the waters—we are in the age
of engines and the engineer. Great problems of mechanical
propulsion, and of construction, are constantly presenting
themselves, and the successors of the ancient mariner, the
modern master, mates, and crew; the "deck department,"
if you will, of the present day steamer, find themselves afloat
with different gear and under different conditions every time
they change vessels.</p>

<p>No standard form of sea training has yet come to take the
place of the old-time apprentice system of sail, and in addition
to ships that are far from standard, we find that many ideas
prevail as to the duties and organization of the seamanship
branch of the modern steamer.</p>

<p>Able as they may be individually, officers of mixed training
are constantly being thrown together in vessels of the
merchant service, while in most cases crews are picked up
haphazard from the beach. It is not to be wondered at that
many ideas prevail as to the proper way of doing things.
Indeed, many otherwise intelligent officers often have a very
hazy notion as to just what they are supposed to do, or to
know.</p>

<p>Seamen are often confused, through lack of knowledge, as
to what may be expected of them; one vessel is run one way,
and another one may be quite different. In fact the lack of
uniformity at sea breeds uncertainty and makes for disorder
in situations where order and discipline are essential.</p>

<p>Among many junior officers in the merchant service a notion
prevails that their main object in life is to get along with
as little effort as possible while awaiting early promotion and
increased pay—they look forward hopefully to that glad day
when they will wear the Master's stripes, with all day ashore,
while in port, and all night in, while at sea—this book will
not be agreeable reading for them.</p>

<p>In the following pages an attempt is made to point out
the things the various members of the deck department of
an ocean steam vessel may reasonably be expected to know,
and the things that they may be required to do. The book
does not pretend to tell HOW, but the object is to show
WHAT a modern American Seaman ought to know, and
to do, and to lay before him the laws by which his calling is
regulated.</p>

<p>It is also hoped that the book will help to inform owners
and shore managers of the kind and quality of service that
they should expect from sea officers and men. It is hoped
that it will also aid in creating a greater respect for the quality
of the men who go down to the sea in steamers; sail has
gone, but a mighty wake of heavy gear and great responsibility
has come along to take its place.</p>

<p>Great Lakes officers and seamen, who are being called to
salt water during the winter season, as a matter of war emergency,
will, it is hoped, find the following pages of use in
their new situations.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be well to remind the hard-working
merchantman that while many things are expected of him
fortunately he is not required to do them all at once, nor
do the United States Local Inspectors examine him upon all
of the things mentioned in the pages of this little book.</p>

<p>The American who goes to sea to-day will not content
himself with minimum requirements. He means to be more
than a ten-per cent seaman. War emergencies have sent
many men out on blue water who formerly would never have
reached the deck or bridge. They know their limitations—all
we can do is to point out the way.</p>

<p>The Author will welcome suggestions and criticisms from
officers and men of the Merchant Marine who happen to read
the pages of this book. Standard practice at sea is desirable,
and such practice can best be achieved by some common
ground upon which all minds may meet and reasonably agree.</p>

<p>Letters addressed in care of my publishers, D. Van Nostrand
Company, 25 Park Place, New York, will be forwarded
to me and be appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Master Mariner who has the vessel in charge is
called the CAPTAIN, or the MASTER, the latter being
his official title. It is correct, however, to address the master
of a vessel as CAPTAIN, a courtesy to which the Master
Mariner is fully entitled through ancient sea usage.</p>

<p>Among seagoing people, the Master Mariner who is in
charge of a vessel <b>is in complete charge at all times</b>; divided
authority in this matter is intolerable to the minds of men
accustomed to the sea.</p>

<p><b>The Master is responsible as follows:—</b></p>

<p><b>For the safe handling of his vessel in and out of port.</b></p>

<p><b>For the safe and expeditious navigation of his vessel from
port to port.</b></p>

<p><b>For the good management, and order, of the various departments
that constitute the internal economy of his vessel—deck—engine—steward's—etc.</b></p>

<p><b>He is responsible for the safety of the lives of passengers
and crew.</b></p>

<p><b>He is responsible for the safe stowage, carriage, and unlading
of the cargo.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
<b>The vessel is his direct responsibility. If the Pilot is
in charge, this does not relieve the Master of his full responsibility.</b></p>

<p><b>The Master is responsible to the owners.</b></p>

<p><b>He is also responsible to the insurance underwriters.</b></p>

<p><b>He is also responsible to the Government of the United
States, under which he receives his license as a Master Mariner.</b></p>

<p>The Master Mariner who is well qualified to bear the
great responsibilities of his station; to have the keeping of
many lives in his charge; to be the sole judge of what is
right and proper in times of emergency; such a man is not
made in a year, nor is he the product of any short-cut system
of training. His sea lore must be learned at sea. His duty
to ship and cargo must be truly come by through close and
thorough contact with the great vessels he is called upon
to command.</p>

<p>The Master Mariner must be a student of the laws governing
his business upon the sea, and of the laws defining his
duties and responsibilities to ship, passengers, crew, and
cargo.</p>

<p>Briefly, he is charged with the following specific duties
and responsibilities:</p>

<p><b>1. The safe navigation of his vessel.</b></p>

<p><b>2. The general management and care of his vessel.</b></p>

<p><b>3. The proper coaling—provisioning—supplying of water—etc.</b></p>

<p><b>4. That she be fully found—anchors—cables—warps—hawsers—boats—
rafts—life-saving equipment—fire-fighting equipment, as required by
law—compasses—chronometers—charts—sailing directions—sextants—and
stores of all kinds needed to safely navigate her.</b></p>

<p><b>5. The proper signing of the ship's articles.</b></p>

<p><b>6. The keeping of the Official Log.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
<b>7. The carrying of a properly equipped medicine chest.</b></p>

<p><b>8. The carrying of a required slop chest, and compliance
with the laws regulating the sale of slops.</b></p>

<p><b>9. He is liable for the wrong delivery of specie and cargo,
or for loss or damage to the same due to carelessness or mismanagement
on the part of the crew.</b></p>

<p><b>10. He is responsible for any neglect through which the
validity of the insurance to ship or cargo is called into question.</b></p>

<p><b>11. He must enforce the rule that the vessel is never to
be left without an officer in charge, either at sea or in harbor,
day or night.</b></p>

<p><b>12. He shall see that a licensed engineer officer is on duty
when steam is up on a boiler.</b></p>

<p><b>13. When maneuvering—in and out of port—or at sea, he
should see that the most qualified engineer officers on board
are in charge of the working of the engines.</b></p>

<p><b>14. He must see that no waste or extravagance is practiced
with the ship's stores and provisions.</b></p>

<p><b>15. He must see that the lawful scale of provisions is issued
to the crew.</b></p>

<p><b>16. He must see that no prohibited cargo or stores come
aboard, and that his hatches are battened down before going
to sea. He is responsible for the correct lading of the vessel.</b></p>

<p><b>17. He must enter and clear his vessel at the custom house.
He must see that the proper papers are produced. Ship's
register (with his name entered as master); Manifest;
Bills of Health; Passenger and stores list; and any other papers
that may be required.</b></p>

<p><b>18. He must be familiar with the laws, rules, and regulations
in force in the various countries and at the various
ports he visits.</b></p>

<p><b>19. He should find out where to obtain the services of the
local medical authorities, and the police authorities, when in a
strange port.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
<b>20. He should study the charter under which he is operating—if
under charter. Is it a "time charter" or a "trip charter"?
He will be largely responsible for the carrying out of his owner's
part of the contract. If abroad he may sign the charter party,
as agent of the owner.</b></p>

<p><b>21. He is the accredited representative of the owner. He
has the authority to act contrary to the wishes of the ship's
agents, when he is satisfied that such action is to the best
interests of his owners; he must be prepared to bear full
responsibility for his actions.</b></p>

<p><b>22. He is responsible to his owners for the safety of his
vessel, whether he is on board or not.</b></p>

<p><b>23. He cannot delegate his authority, or name his successor
to command, without the consent of his owners—unless
physically unfit for duty, and then he has the authority to retain
command and delegate such duties as he may be unable to
perform himself.</b></p>

<p><b>24. He is always in command of and responsible for the
safety of the vessel, whether he is using the services of a
pilot, or otherwise, and his station, while in pilot waters under
way, is on the bridge.</b></p>

<p><b>25. He has the authority to take the vessel from the pilot's
control at any time, when in his opinion her safety demands
such action. The use of the pilot indicates that the most
careful measures are being taken to prevent accident, and
for the protection of the insurance underwriters. Under such
conditions, the taking over of the vessel from the pilot is
weighted with the fullest responsibility.</b></p>

<p><b>26. He is responsible for the correct keeping of the wage
account of the crew.</b></p>

<p><b>27. He is responsible for the safe carriage of mail entrusted
to the vessel.</b></p>

<p><b>28. He is responsible for the acceptance on board of anyone
except his crew, or regularly accredited passengers. He is
accountable to the port authorities of the first port visited, for
the presence of the same.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
<b>29. He must see that the legal requirements safeguarding
the carriage of live stock are complied with.</b></p>

<p><b>30. He shall handle his vessel in conformity with the
International Rules of the Road at Sea, or the Inland Rules,
depending upon the waters in which he is navigating; he must
know if he is on the high seas, or within the limits defined as
inland waters.</b></p>

<p><b>31. He is the responsible navigator of his vessel, and cannot
delegate this responsibility.</b></p>

<p><b>32. He must see that the officers and men respect the laws
and regulations of the ports visited, that no contraband or
dutiable articles are brought on board in violation of the same.</b></p>

<p><b>33. He must take steps to prevent smuggling.</b></p>

<p><b>34. He must keep a record of all fines, punishments, and
charges against members of the crew, and must not permit
punishment to be inflicted that is contrary to law, and only
such punishment as is sanctioned by his express order. In
the Official Log, where these entries are to be made, he must
specify the nature and extent of the punishment.</b></p>

<p><b>35. In the Official Log Book he must enter the following:</b></p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> Every legal conviction of any member of his crew, and the

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
LAWS AFFECTING THE DUTIES OF THE MASTER</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> principal laws of the United States affecting the
duties and responsibilities of the Master are appended.
Much of the bulk of the law, having to do with the construction
of vessels and their fitting, and regulating the
methods of inspection and control are omitted, and only
those parts are given that directly affect the Master himself.</p>

<p>Much of the law, to the mind of a sailor, could be boiled
down and simplified—perhaps some day sailors will go to
Congress and do this—in the mean time the best that can
be done is to make an attempt to unscramble the hodge-podge
of rules, regulations, specifications, penalties, and what
not, that fill the bulky red volume issued by the Bureau of
Navigation, Department of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Master's oath of citizenship. Upon making application for
registry of a vessel.</h3>

<p>If the master of a vessel is within the district where a registry
thereof is to be made, when application is made for registering the
same, he shall himself, instead of the owner, or of the agent, or attorney,
as hereinafter mentioned, make oath touching his being a citizen,
and the means whereby or manner in which he is citizen; in which
case, if the master shall knowingly swear to anything untrue, no
forfeiture of the vessel, on account of such false oath, shall be incurred,
but the master shall be liable to a penalty of one thousand dollars.
(R. S., 4144.)</p>

<h3>Change of master.</h3>

<p>When the master or person having the charge or command of a
registered vessel is changed, the owner, or one of the owners, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
new master of such vessel, shall report such change to the collector
of the district where the same has happened, or where the vessel
shall first be after the same has happened, and shall produce to him
the certificate of registry of such vessel, and shall make oath, showing
that such new master is a citizen of the United States, and the
manner in which or means whereby he is so a citizen. Thereupon
the collector shall indorse upon the certificate of registry a memorandum
of such change, specifying the name of such new master, and
shall subscribe the memorandum with his name; and if other than
the collector of the district by whom the certificate of registry was
granted, shall transmit a copy of the memorandum to him, with
notice of the particular vessel to which it relates; and the collector
of the district, by whom the certificate shall have been granted, shall
make a like memorandum of such change in his book of registers,
and shall transmit a copy thereof to the Commissioner of Navigation.
If the change is not reported, or if the oath is not taken, as
above directed, the registry of such vessel shall be void, and the master
or person having the charge or command of her shall be liable to a
penalty of one hundred dollars. (R. S., 4171—July 5, 1884; sec. 2.)</p>

<h3>Master must produce ship's register when entry is made.</h3>

<p>The master or other person having the command or charge of
any vessel, recorded in pursuance of this Title [R. S., 4131-4305],
shall, on entry of such vessel, produce the certificate of such record
to the collector of the district where she is so entered; and in default
thereof the vessel shall not be entitled to the privileges of a recorded
vessel. (R. S., 4184.)</p>

<h3>Offenses against the registry law.</h3>

<p>Every collector or officer who knowingly makes, or is concerned
in making, any false register or record, or who knowingly grants or is
concerned in granting, any false certificate of registry or record
of or for any vessel, or any other false document whatever touching
the same, contrary to the true intent and meaning of this Title [R. S.,
4131-4305], or who designedly takes any other or greater fees than
are by this Title allowed, or who receives any voluntary reward or
gratuity for any of the services performed, pursuant thereto; and every
surveyor or other person appointed to measure any vessel, who willfully
delivers to any collector or naval officer a false description of
such vessel, to be registered or recorded, shall be punishable by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
fine of one thousand dollars, and be rendered incapable of serving
in any office of trust or profit under the United States. (R. S.,
4187.)</p>

<p>If any person authorized and required by this Title [R. S., 4131-4305]
to perform, as an officer, any act or thing, willfully neglects to
do or perform the same, according to the true intent and meaning
of this Title, he shall, if not subject to the penalty and disqualification
prescribed in the preceding section, be punishable by a fine of
five hundred dollars for the first offense, and by a like fine for the
second offense, and shall thenceforth be rendered incapable of holding
any office of trust or profit under the United States. (R. S., 4188.)</p>

<p>Whenever any certificate of registry, enrollment, or license, or
other record or document granted in lieu thereof, to any vessel, is
knowingly and fraudulently obtained or used for any vessel not
entitled to the benefit thereof, such vessel, with her tackle, apparel,
and furniture, shall be liable to forfeiture. (R. S., 4187.)</p>

<p>No sea-letter or other document certifying or proving any vessel
to be the property of a citizen of the United States shall be issued,
except to vessels duly registered, or enrolled and licensed as vessels
of the United States, or to vessels which shall be wholly owned by
citizens of the United States, and furnished with or entitled to sea-letters
or other custom-house documents. (R. S., 4190.)</p>

<p>Every person who knowingly makes, utters, or publishes any false
sea-letter, Mediterranean passport, or certificate of registry, or who
knowingly avails himself of any such Mediterranean passport,
sea-letter, or certificate of registry, shall be liable to a penalty of
not more than five thousand dollars, and, if an officer of the United
States, shall thenceforth be incapable of holding any office of trust
or profit under the authority of the United States. (R. S., 4191.)</p>

<h3>Provisions and water.</h3>

<p>Should any master or owner of any merchant vessel of the United
States neglect to provide a sufficient quantity of stores to last for a
voyage of ordinary duration to the port of destination, and in consequence
of such neglect the crew are compelled to accept a reduced
scale, such master or owner shall be liable to a penalty as provided
in section forty-five hundred and sixty-eight of the Revised Statutes.
(R. S., 4564. Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 12.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
Any three or more of the crew of any merchant-vessel of the
United States bound from a port in the United States to any foreign
port, or being of the burden of seventy-five tons or upward, and bound
from a port on the Atlantic to a port on the Pacific, or vice versa,
may complain to any officer in command of any of the vessels of the
United States Navy, or consular officer of the United States, or shipping-commissioner
or chief officer of the customs, that the provisions
or water for the use of the crew are, at any time, of bad quality,
unfit for use, or deficient in quantity. Such officer shall thereupon
examine the provisions or water, or cause them to be examined; and
if, on examination, such provisions or water are found to be of bad
quality and unfit for use, or to be deficient in quantity, the person
making such examination shall certify the same in writing to the
master of the ship. If such master does not thereupon provide
other proper provisions or water, where the same can be had, in lieu
of any so certified to be of a bad quality and unfit for use, or does
not procure the requisite quantity of any so certified to be insufficient
in quantity, or uses any provisions or water which have been
so certified as aforesaid to be of bad quality and unfit for use, he
shall, in every such case, be liable to a penalty of not more than
one hundred dollars; and upon every such examination the officers
making or directing the same shall enter a statement of the result
of the examination in the log-book, and shall send a report thereof
to the district judge for the judicial district embracing the port to
which such vessel is bound; and such report shall be received in
evidence in any legal proceedings. (R. S., 4565.)</p>

<p>If the officer to whom any such complaint in regard to the provisions
or the water is made certifies in such statement that there was
no reasonable ground for such complaint, each of the parties so complaining
shall forfeit to the master or owner his share of the expense,
if any, of the survey. [This section shall not apply to fishing or
whaling vessels or yachts—Dec. 21, 1898, sec. 26.] (R. S., 4566.
Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 13.)</p>

<p>If any seamen, while on board any vessel, shall state to the
master that they desire to make complaint, in accordance with the
two preceding sections, in regard to the provisions or the water,
to a competent officer, against the master, the master shall, if the
vessel is then at a place where there is any such officer, so soon as
the service of the vessel will permit, and if the vessel is not then at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
such a place, so soon after her first arrival at such place as the service
of the vessel will permit, allow such seamen, or any of them, to go
ashore, or shall send them ashore, in proper custody, so that they
may be enabled to make such complaint; and shall, in default, be
liable to a penalty of not more than one hundred dollars. (R. S.,
4567.)</p>

<p>If, during a voyage, the allowance of any of the provisions which
any seaman is entitled to under section forty-six hundred and twelve
of the Revised Statutes is reduced except for any time during which
such seamen willfully and without sufficient cause refuses or neglects
to perform his duty, or is lawfully under confinement for misconduct
either on board or on shore; or if it shall be shown that any of such
provisions are, or have been during the voyage, bad in quality or
unfit for use, the seaman shall receive, by way of compensation for
such reduction or bad quality, according to the time of its continuance,
the following sums, to be paid to him in addition to and to
be recoverable as wages:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> If his allowance is reduced by any quantity not exceeding
one-third of the quantity specified by law, a sum not exceeding
fifty cents a day.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> If his allowance is reduced by more than one-third of
such quantity, a sum not exceeding one dollar a day.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> In respect to bad quality, a sum not exceeding one dollar
a day.</p>

</div>

<p>But if it is shown to the satisfaction of the court before which
the case is tried that any provisions, the allowance of which has
been reduced, could not be procured or supplied in sufficient quantities,
or were unavoidably injured or lost, or if by reason of its innate
qualities any article becomes unfit for use and that proper and equivalent
substitutes were supplied in lieu thereof, the court shall take
such circumstances into consideration and shall modify or refuse
compensation, as the justice of the case may require. [This section
shall not apply to fishing or whaling vessels or yachts—Dec. 21, 1898,
sec. 26.] (R. S., 4568. Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 14.)</p>

<h3>Weights and measures.</h3>

<p>Every master shall keep on board proper weights and measures
for the purpose of determining the quantities of the several provisions
and articles served out, and shall allow the same to be used at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
time of serving out such provisions and articles, in the presence of a
witness, whenever any dispute arises about such quantities, and in
default shall, for every offense, be liable to a penalty of not more
than fifty dollars. (R. S., 4571.)</p>

<h3>Medicines and anti-scorbutics.</h3>

to be relanded within the United States, and that if by distress or
other unavoidable accident it shall become necessary to reland the
same, I will forthwith make a just and true report thereof to the
collector of the customs of the district wherein such distress or
accident may happen. So help me God. (R. S., 4198; Apr. 29,

States, duly registered as such, and bound on any foreign voyage,
the collector of the district shall annex thereto, in every case, a copy

from such consular officer, and, after certifying as to whether such
statement is correct, to furnish it to the collector of the district
in which such vessels shall first arrive on their return to the United
States; and if any such master of a vessel shall fail to furnish such statement,
he shall be liable to a fine of not exceeding fifty dollars, unless
such master shall state under oath that no such statement was
furnished him by said consular officer. And it shall be the duty of
every collector to forward to the Secretary of the Treasury all such
statements as shall have been furnished to him, and also a statement

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
vessel may be, with a passport, the form for which shall be prescribed
by the Secretary of State. In order to be entitled to such
passport, the master of every such vessel shall be bound, with sufficient
sureties, to the Treasurer of the United States, in the penalty
of two thousand dollars, conditioned that the passport shall not be
applied to the use or protection of any other vessel than the one

having such passport, the same shall, within three months, be delivered
up to the collector from whom it was received, if the loss or sale
take place within the United States; or within six months, if the same
shall happen at any place nearer than the Cape of Good Hope;
and within eighteen months, if at a more distant place. (R. S.,
4306.)</p>

vessel may be with a passport, for which the master shall be subject
to the rules and conditions prescribed for vessels of the United
States. (R. S., 4308.)</p>

<p>Every master of a vessel, belonging to citizens of the United
States, who shall sail from any port of the United States, shall,

agent, or vice-commercial agent, if any there be at such port; and
it shall be the duty of such consul, vice-consul, commercial agent, or
vice-commercial agent, on such master or commander producing
to him a clearance from the proper officer of the port where his vessel
may be, to deliver to the master all of his papers, if such master or
commander has complied with the provisions of law relating to the
discharge of seamen in a foreign country, and to the payment of the
fees of consular officers. (R. S., 4309.)</p>

<p>Every master of any such vessel who refuses or neglects to deposit
the papers as required by the preceding section, shall be liable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
to a penalty of five hundred dollars, to be recovered by such consul,
vice consul, commercial agent, or vice-commercial agent, in his own
name, for the benefit of the United States, in any court of competent
jurisdiction. (R. S., 4310.)</p>

<h3>Illegal boarding of vessel.</h3>

<p>Every person who, not being in the United States service, and
not being duly authorized by law for the purpose, goes on board

her actual arrival, and before she has been completely moored, without
permission of the master, shall, for every such offense, be punishable
by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars, and by imprisonment
for not more than six months; and the master of such
vessel may take any such person so going on board into custody,
and deliver him up forthwith to any constable or police officer, to
be by him taken before any justice of the peace, to be dealt with
according to the provisions of this Title (R. S., 4501-4613). (R. S.,
4606.)</p>

<p>The Secretary of Commerce is hereby authorized and directed to
prescribe from time to time and enforce regulations governing the
boarding of vessels arriving at the seaports of the United States,
before such vessels have been properly inspected and placed in security,
and for that purpose to employ any of the officers of that [or
Treasury] Department. (Mar. 31, 1900; Feb. 14, 1903; sec. 10.)</p>

<p>Each person violating such regulations shall be subject to a
penalty of not more than one hundred dollars or imprisonment not
to exceed six months, or both, in the discretion of the court. (Mar.
31, 1900; sec. 2.)</p>

for the purpose in writing by a collector, naval officer, or surveyor,
to go on board of any vessel, as well without as within his district,
and to inspect, search, and examine the same, and any person, trunk,
or envelope on board, and to this end to hail and stop such vessel if
under way, and to use all necessary force to compel compliance;
and if it shall appear that any breach or violation of the laws of the
United States has been committed, whereby or in consequence of
which such vessel, or the merchandise, or any part thereof, on board
of or imported by such vessel, is liable to forfeiture, to make seizure
of the same, or either or any part thereof, and to arrest, or in case
of escape, or any attempt to escape, to pursue and arrest any person
engaged in such breach or violation. (R. S., 3059.)</p>

<p>The original appointment in writing of any person specially
appointed under the provisions of the previous section shall be
filed in the custom-house where such appointment is made. (R. S.,
3060.)</p>

<p>It shall be lawful for all collectors, naval officers, surveyors,
inspectors, and the officers of the revenue-cutters, to go on board of
vessels in any port of the United States, or within four leagues of
the coast thereof, if bound to the United States, whether in or out
of their respective districts, for the purpose of demanding the manifests,
and of examining and searching the vessels; and those officers
respectively shall have free access to the cabin and every part of a
vessel. (R. S., 3067.)</p>

<p>If any master of a vessel coming into or having arrived at any
port within the United States, shall obstruct or hinder or shall intentionally
cause any obstructions or hindrance to any officer in lawfully
going on board such vessel for the purpose of carrying into
effect any of the revenue laws of the United States, he shall for every
such offense be liable to a penalty of not more than five hundred dollars
nor less than fifty dollars. (R. S., 3068.)</p>

<p>If any box, trunk, chest, cask, or other package shall be found
in the cabin, steerage, or forecastle of a vessel, or in any other place
separate from the residue of the cargo, the officer of the customs
shall take a particular account of such package, and of the marks and
numbers thereof, if any, and a description thereof, and, if he judges
proper, shall seal every such package; and such account and description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
shall be by him forwarded without delay to the collector of the
district to which such vessel is bound. If upon her arrival at the
port of her entry, the packages so described, or any of them, are
missing, or if any seal put thereon has been broken, the master shall
be liable to a penalty for every package missing, or on which any
seal shall be broken, of two hundred dollars. (R. S., 3069.)</p>

consigned to one consignee, arriving at a port for orders, may be
permitted to destine such cargo or determine its disposition "for
orders," upon entering the vessel at the custom-house, and, within
fifteen days afterward and before the unloading of any part of the
cargo, to amend the manifest by designating the actual port of discharge
of such cargo:</p>

<p><i>Provided further</i>, That in the event of failure to designate the
port of discharge within fifteen days such cargo must be discharged
at the port where the vessel entered. (June 3, 1892.)</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> The name, description, and build of the vessel; the true
admeasurement or tonnage thereof; the port to which such vessel
belongs; the name of each owner, according to the register of the
same; and the name of the master of such vessel.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> A just and particular account of all the merchandise, so
laden on board, whether in packages or stowed loose, of any kind
or nature whatever, together with the marks and numbers as marked
on each package, and the number or quantity and description of the
packages in words at length, whether leaguer, pipe, butt, puncheon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
hogshead, barrel, keg, case, bale, pack, truss, chest, box, band-box,
bundle, parcel, cask, or package, of any kind or sort, describing the
same by its usual name or denomination.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> The names of the persons to whom such packages are
respectively consigned, agreeably to the bills of lading signed for
the same, unless when the goods are consigned to order, when it
shall be so expressed in the manifest.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> The names of the several passengers on board the vessel,
distinguishing whether cabin or steerage passengers, or both, with their
baggage, specifying the number and description of packages belonging
to each respectively. (R. S., 2807.)</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i> An account of the sea-stores remaining, if any.</p>

</div>

<p>If merchandise shall be imported, destined to be delivered in
different districts or ports, the quantities and packages so destined
to be delivered shall be inserted in successive order in the manifest;
and all spirits and wines constituting the whole or any part of the
cargo of any vessel shall also be inserted in successive order, distinguishing
the ports to which the same may be destined, and the
kinds, qualities, and quantities thereof. (R. S., 2808.)</p>

<p>If any merchandise is brought into the United States in any
vessel whatever from any foreign port without having such a manifest
on board, or which shall not be included or described in the
manifest, or shall not agree therewith, the master shall be liable
to a penalty equal to the value of such merchandise not included in
such manifest; and all such merchandise not included in the manifest
belonging or consigned to the master, mate, officers, or crew of
such vessel, shall be forfeited. (R. S., 2809.)</p>

<p>Whenever it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the collector,
naval officer, and surveyor, or to the major part of them,
where those officers are established at any port, or to the satisfaction
of the collector alone, where either of the other of the officers is not
established, or to the satisfaction of the court in which a trial shall
be had concerning such forfeiture, that no part of the cargo of any
vessel without proper manifest was unshipped, after it was taken on
board, except such as shall have been particularly specified and
accounted for in the report of the master, and that the manifests
have been lost or mislaid, without fraud or collusion, or were defaced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
by accident, or became incorrect by mistake, no forfeiture or penalty
shall be incurred under the preceding section. (R. S., 2810.)</p>

<h3>Ports of entry.</h3>

<p>It shall not be lawful to make entry of any vessel which shall
arrive within the United States, from any foreign port, or of the cargo
on board such vessel, elsewhere than at one of the ports of entry
designated in chapter one [R. S., 2517-2612] of this Title [R. S., 2517-3129];
nor to unlade the cargo, or any part thereof, elsewhere than
at one of the ports of delivery therein designated, except that every
port of entry shall be also a port of delivery. This section shall not
prevent the master or commander of any vessel from making entry
with the collector of any district in which such vessel may be owned,
or from which she may have sailed on the voyage from which she
shall then have returned. (R. S., 2770.)</p>

<h3>Vessels bound to port of delivery.</h3>

<p>The master of every vessel bound to a port of delivery only, in
any district, shall first come to at the port of entry of such district,
with his vessel, and there make report and entry in writing, and pay
all duties required by law, port fees and charges, before such vessel
shall proceed to her port of delivery. Any master of a vessel who
shall proceed to a port of delivery contrary to such directions shall
be liable to a penalty of five hundred dollars, to be recovered with
costs of suit. (R. S., 2772.)</p>

<h3>Report and declaration of master.</h3>

<p>Within twenty-four hours after the arrival of any vessel, from
any foreign port, at any port of the United States established by law,
at which an officer of the customs resides, or within any harbor, inlet,
or creek thereof, in the hours of business at the office of the chief
officer of the customs at such port will permit, or as soon thereafter
as such hours will permit, the master shall repair to such office,
and make report to the chief officer, of the arrival of the vessel;
and he shall, within forty-eight hours after such arrival, make a
further report in writing to the collector of the district, which report
shall be in the form, and shall contain all the particulars required to
be inserted in, and verified like, a manifest. Every master who shall
neglect or omit to make either of such reports and declarations, or
to verify any such declaration as required, or shall not fully comply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
with the true intent and meaning of this section, shall, for each
offense, be liable to a penalty of one thousand dollars. (R. S.,
2774.)</p>

<p>The master of any vessel having on board distilled spirits, or
wines, shall, within forty-eight hours after his arrival, whether the
same be at the first port of arrival of such vessel or not, in addition
to the requirements of the preceding section, report in writing to the
surveyor or officer acting as inspector of the revenue of the port at
which he has arrived, the foreign port from which he last sailed,
the name of his vessel, his own name, the tonnage and denomination
of such vessel, and to what nation belonging, together with the
quantity and kinds of spirits and wines, on board of the vessel,
particularizing the number of casks, vessels, cases, or other packages
containing the same, with their marks and numbers, as also the
quantity and kinds of spirits and wines, on board such vessel as sea-stores,
and in default thereof he shall be liable to a penalty of five
hundred dollars and any spirits omitted to be reported shall be
forfeited. (R. S., 2775.)</p>

<p>If any vessel, having arrived within the limits of any collection-district,
from any foreign port, departs, or attempts to depart from
the same, unless to proceed on her way to some more interior district
to which she may be bound, before report or entry shall have been
made by the master with the collector of some district, the master
shall be liable to a penalty of four hundred dollars; and any collector,
naval officer, surveyor, or commander of any revenue cutter
may cause such vessel to be arrested and brought back to the most
convenient port of the United States. If, however, it is made to
appear by the oath of the master, and of the person next in command,
or by other sufficient proof to the satisfaction of the collector of the
district within which such vessel shall afterward come, or to the satisfaction
of the court in which the prosecution for such penalty may
be had, that the departure or attempt to depart was occasioned by
stress of weather, pursuit or duress of enemies, or other necessity,
the penalty imposed by this section shall not be incurred. (R. S.,
2773.)</p>

<h3>Special inward manifest for Treasury Department.</h3>

<p>Each master of a vessel arriving in the United States from a foreign
port except vessels carrying traffic in bond on transfer ferries shall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
immediately upon landing and before entering his vessel at the custom-house,
mail to the Auditor for the Treasury Department, Washington,
a true copy of the manifest of his vessel, and shall on entering
his vessel make affidavit that he has mailed such copy and that the
same is true and correct; and he shall also mail to the said Auditor
a true copy of the corrected manifest filed on any post entry of his
vessel. Any master who neglects or refuses to mail to the Auditor
the required copy of the original or corrected manifest shall be subject
to the same fines and penalties fixed by law for his failure to
deliver the manifest of his vessel to the collector: <i>Provided</i>, That
this section shall not apply to ports where there is a naval officer.
(Mar. 2, 1895; sec. 9.)</p>

<h3>Cargo in bulk.</h3>

<p>Vessels arriving at a port of entry in the United States, laden
with coal, salt, railroad iron and other like articles in bulk may proceed
to places within that collection district to be specially designated
by the Secretary of the Treasury by general regulations or otherwise,
under the superintendence of customs officers, at the expense
of the parties interested, for the purpose of unlading cargoes of
the character before mentioned. (R. S., 2776; June 26, 1884;
sec. 29.)</p>

<h3>Bond of cargo for re-export.</h3>

<p>Any vessel may proceed with any merchandise brought in her,
and, in the manifest delivered to the collector of the customs, reported
as destined for any foreign port, from the district within which
such vessel shall first arrive to such foreign port without paying or
securing the payment of any duties upon such merchandise as shall
be actually re-exported in the vessel. But the manifest so declaring
to re-export such merchandise shall be delivered to such collector
within forty-eight hours after the arrival of the vessel. And the
master of such vessel shall give bond as required by the next section.
(R. S., 2776.)</p>

<p>The master of any vessel so destined for a foreign port shall give
bond, with one or more sureties, in a sum equal to the amount of the
duties upon the merchandise, as the same shall be estimated by the
collector and naval officer of the port where the report shall be made,
to the satisfaction of the collector, with condition that the merchandise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
or any part thereof, shall not be landed within the United States,
unless due entry thereof shall have been first made and the duties
thereupon paid, according to law. Such bond shall be taken for the
same period, and canceled in like manner, as a bond given for obtaining
drawback of duties. No such bond shall be required in respect
to merchandise on board of any vessel which has put into the United
States from a necessity, shown as prescribed in section twenty-seven
hundred and seventy-three. (R. S., 2777.)</p>

<p>The collector receiving any bond conditioned for the payment
of duties upon merchandise reported as destined for a foreign port,
in case the same shall be landed within the United States, or any
other bonds taken upon the exportation of merchandise entitled to
drawback, shall immediately after the time when by the conditions
of the same they ought to be canceled, put the same in suit, provided
the proof of the occurrence of such a necessity as excuses a landing
of such goods within the United States has not been produced, or
further time granted therefor by the Secretary of the Treasury.
(R. S., 2778.)</p>

<h3>Inspection of merchandise laden for export.</h3>

<p>The collector shall direct the surveyor, where any, to inspect,
or cause to be inspected, the merchandise notified for exportation,
and if it is found to correspond fully with the notice and proof concerning
the same, the collector, together with the naval officer, if
any, shall grant a permit for lading the same on board of the vessel
named in such notice and entry. Such lading shall be performed
under the superintendence of the officer by whom the same has
been so inspected; and the exporter shall make oath that the merchandise,
so noticed for exportation, and laden on board such vessel,
previous to the clearance thereof, or within ten days after such
clearance, is truly intended to be exported to the place whereof
notice has been given, and is not intended to be relanded within
the United States; otherwise the merchandise shall not be entitled
to the benefit of drawback. (R. S., 3035.)</p>

<h3>Transfer of imported merchandise for export.</h3>

<p>All merchandise imported into the United States, the duties on
which have been paid, or secured to be paid, may be transported
by land, or partly by land and partly by water, or coastwise, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
district into which it was imported to any port of entry and exported
from such port of entry with the benefit of drawback. (R. S., 3036.)</p>

<h3>Delivery of cargo in various districts.</h3>

<p>Any vessel in which any merchandise is brought into the United
States from any foreign port, and which is specified in the manifest
verified before the collector of the port in which such vessel first
arrives, to be destined for other districts, may proceed with the same
from district to district within the United States, in order to the
landing or delivery thereof; and the duties on such of the merchandise
only as shall be landed in any district shall be paid within such
district. (R. S., 2779.)</p>

<p>Before any vessel departs from the district in which she shall
first arrive for another district, provided such departure is not within
forty-eight hours after her arrival within such district, with merchandise
brought in such vessel from a foreign port on which the duties
have not been paid, the master shall obtain from the collector of the
district from which she is about to depart, who is hereby required
to grant the same, a copy of the report and manifest made by such
master, certified by the collector, to which copy shall be annexed a
certificate of the quantity and particulars of the merchandise which
appears to him to have been landed within his district, or of the
quantity and particulars of the merchandise which remains on
board and upon which the duties are to be paid in some other district.
(R. S., 2780.)</p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours after the arrival of such vessel within
any other district, the master shall make report or entry to or with
the collector of such other district, producing and showing the certified
copy of his first report, together with a certificate from each collector
of any other district within which any of the merchandise,
brought in such vessel, has been landed, of the quantity and particulars
of such merchandise as has been landed in each district
respectively. (R. S., 2781.)</p>

<p>The master shall, however, first give bond, with one or more
sureties, to the satisfaction of the collector of the district within which
the vessel first arrives, in a sum equal to the amount of the duties
on the residue of the merchandise, according to such estimate as the
collector shall form thereof, with condition that the residue of such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
merchandise shall be duly entered and delivered in another district
for which the same has been reported to be destined. (R. S., 2782.)</p>

<p>The bond shall be canceled or discharged within six calendar
months from the date thereof, by the production of certificates from
the collectors of the districts for which the merchandise has been
reported, showing the due entry and delivery of the merchandise
in such districts, or upon due proof to the satisfaction of the collector
by whom the bond was taken, and to the naval officer of the port,
if any, that such entry and delivery were prevented by some unavoidable
accident or casualty, and if the whole or any part of the
merchandise has not been lost, that it has been duly entered and
delivered within the United States. (R. S., 2783.)</p>

<p>If the master of any such vessel fails by his neglect or fault to
obtain the copy of his report from the collector of the district from
which he is about to depart, or any certificate which he ought to
obtain, or neglects to exhibit the same to the collector of any other
district to which the vessel afterward proceeds, within the time for
that purpose allowed, he shall be liable to a penalty, for every such
neglect or omission, of five hundred dollars. (R. S., 2784.)</p>

<h3>Vessels exempt from entry.</h3>

<p>It shall not be necessary for the master of any vessel of war,
or of any vessel employed by any prince, or state, as a public packet
for the conveyance of letters and dispatches, and not permitted by
the laws of such prince or state to be employed in the transportation
of merchandise, in the way of trade, to make report and entry.
(R. S., 2791.)</p>

<p>Any passenger vessel engaged triweekly or oftener in trade
between ports of the United States and foreign ports shall be exempt
from entrance and clearance fees and tonnage taxes while such service
triweekly or oftener is maintained. (May 28, 1908.)</p>

<h3>Sea-stores.</h3>

<p>In order to ascertain what articles ought to be exempt from
duty as the sea-stores of a vessel, the master shall particularly specify
the articles, in the report or manifest to be by him made, designating
them as the sea-stores of such vessel; and in the oath to be taken by
such master, on making such report, he shall declare that the articles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
so specified as sea-stores are truly such, and are not intended by way
of merchandise or for sale; whereupon the articles shall be free from
duty. (R. S., 2795.)</p>

<p>Whenever it appears to the collector to whom a report and manifest
of sea-stores are delivered, together with the naval officer, where
there is one, or alone, where there is no naval officer, that the quantities
of the articles, or any part thereof, reported as sea-stores, are
excessive, the collector, jointly with the naval officer, or alone, as the
case may be, may in his discretion estimate the amount of the duty
on such excess; which shall be forthwith paid by the master, to the
collector, on pain of forfeiting the value of such excess. (R. S.,
2796.)</p>

<p>If any other or greater quantity of articles are found on board
such vessel as sea-stores than are specified in an entry of sea-stores,
or if any of the articles are landed without a permit first obtained
from the collector, and naval officer if any, for that purpose, all
such articles as are not included in the report or manifest by the
master, and all which are landed without a permit, shall be forfeited,
and may be seized; and the master shall moreover be liable
to a penalty of treble the value of the articles omitted or landed.
(R. S., 2797.)</p>

<p>Sea-stores and the legitimate equipment of vessels belonging
to regular lines plying between foreign ports and the United States
delayed in port for any cause may be transferred in such port of the
United States under the supervision of the customs officers from
one vessel to another vessel of the same owner without payment of
duties, but duties must be paid on such stores or equipments landed
for consumption, except American products. (Mar. 3, 1897; sec.
17.)</p>

<h3>Coal.</h3>

<p>The master of any vessel propelled by steam, arriving at any
port in the United States, may retain all the coal such vessel may have
on board at the time of her arrival, and may proceed with such coal
to a foreign port, without being required to land the same in the
United States, or to pay any duty thereon. (R. S., 2798.)</p>

<h3>Inspection of inward manifests by boarding officer.</h3>

<p>Every master of any vessel laden with merchandise, and bound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
to any port in the United States shall, on his arrival within four
leagues of the coast thereof, or within any of the bays, harbors,
ports, rivers, creeks, or inlets, thereof, upon demand, produce the
manifests in writing, which such master is required to have on board
his vessel, to such officer of the customs as first comes on board his
vessel, for inspection, and shall deliver to such officer true copies
thereof, which copies shall be provided and subscribed by the master,
and the officer to whom the original manifests have been produced
shall certify upon the back thereof that the same were produced, and
the day and year on which the same were so produced, and that such
copies were to him delivered and by him examined with the original
manifest; and shall likewise certify upon the back of such copies
the day and year on which the same were delivered, and shall forthwith
transmit such copies to the respective collectors of the several
districts, to which the goods by such manifests appear respectively
to be consigned. (R. S., 2811.)</p>

<p>The master of any such vessel shall in like manner produce to
the officer of the customs who first comes on board such vessel, upon
her arrival within the limits of any collection-district in which the
cargo, or any part thereof, is intended to be discharged or landed,
for his inspection, such manifest; and shall also deliver to him true
copies thereof, such copies also to be provided and subscribed by
the master, the production of which manifests and the delivery of
which copies shall also be certified by the officer of the customs,
upon the back of the original manifests, with the particular day and
year when such manifests were produced to such officer, and when
he so received the copies thereof; and such officer is required forthwith
to transmit the copies of the manifest to the collector of the
district; and the master shall afterward deliver the original manifests
so certified to the collector. When any manifest shall be produced,
upon which there shall be no certificate from any officer of
the customs as before mentioned, the master producing the same
shall be required to make oath that no officer has applied for, and
that no indorsement has taken place on, any manifest of the cargo
of such vessel. (R. S., 2812.)</p>

<p>The master of any such vessel shall not be required to make
delivery of more than one copy of each manifest to the officer who
shall first come on board of such vessel, within four leagues of the
coast of the United States, and one other copy to such officer as shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
first come on board within the limits of any collection-district, for
which the cargo of such vessel, or some part thereof, is destined, nor
to make delivery of any such copy to any other officer; but it shall
be sufficient, in respect to any such other officer, to exhibit, to him
the original manifest and the certificates thereupon. (R. S., 2813.)</p>

<p>If the master of any vessel laden with merchandise, and bound to
any port in the United States, fails upon his arrival within four leagues
of the coast thereof, or within the limits of any collection-district,
where the cargo of such vessel, or any part thereof, is intended to
be discharged, to produce such manifests, as are heretofore required,
in writing, to the proper officer upon demand therefor, or to deliver
such copies thereof, according to the directions of the preceding,
sections or if he fails to give an account of the true destination of the
vessel, which he is hereby required to do, upon request of such officer,
or gives a false account of such destination, in order to evade the
production of the manifests, the master shall for every such neglect,
refusal, or offense, be liable to a penalty of not more than five hundred
dollars. If any officer first coming on board, in each case, shall
neglect or refuse to certify on the back of such manifests the production
thereof, and the delivery of such copies respectively as are directed
to be delivered to such officer, such officer shall be liable to a penalty
of five hundred dollars. (R. S., 2814.)</p>

<p>The officers who may apply to the master of any such vessel,
respecting any of the provisions in the preceding sections, and who
shall not receive full satisfaction therein, are hereby required to make
a return in writing of the name of the vessel and master so offending,
in any or all of the particulars required, as soon as possible, to the
collector of the district to which such vessel shall be considered to
be bound. (R. S., 2815.)</p>

<p>Collectors and surveyors, respectively, may, whenever they
judge it to be necessary for the security of the revenue, put an inspector
of the customs on board any vessel, to accompany the same
until her arrival at the first port of entry or delivery, in the district
to which such vessel may be destined. If the master of any vessel
shall neglect or omit to deposit a manifest as herein prescribed, or
shall refuse to receive an inspector of the customs on board, as the
case requires, he shall forfeit and pay five hundred dollars, to be
recovered with cost of suit, one-half for the use of the officer with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
whom such manifest ought to have been deposited, and the other
half to the use of the collector of the district to which such vessel
may be bound. If, however, the manifest shall, in either of the
above cases, have been previously delivered to any officer of the
customs, pursuant to the provisions hereinafter made in that behalf,
the depositing of a manifest shall not be necessary. (R. S., 2834;
Mar. 3, 1897; sec. 15.)</p>

<h3>Entry of merchandise for different port of destination.</h3>

<p>The importer, or his agent, may enter merchandise at the port
of entry for the collection-district into which it is to be imported in
the usual manner; and the collector shall grant a permit for the landing
thereof, and cause the duties to be ascertained as in other cases,
the goods remaining in the custody of the collector until reshipped
for the place of destination. The collector shall certify to the surveyor
at such place the amount of such duties, which the surveyor
shall enter on the margin of the bond given to secure the same;
and the merchandise shall be delivered by the collector to the agent
of the importer or consignee, duly authorized to receive the same,
for shipment to the place of destination. (R. S., 2826.)</p>

<p>The master or conductor of every vessel or vehicle in which such
merchandise shall be transported, shall, previously to departure
from the port of entry, deliver to the collector duplicate manifests
of such merchandise, specifying the marks and numbers of every
case, bag, box, chest, or package, containing the same, with the name
and place of residence of every importer or consignee of such merchandise,
and the quantity shipped to each, to be by him subscribed,
and to the truth of which he shall swear, and that the merchandise
has been received on board his vessel or vehicle, stating the name of
the agent who shipped the same; and the collector shall certify the
facts, on the manifests, one of which he shall return to the master,
with a permit thereto annexed, authorizing him to proceed to the place
of his destination. (R. S., 2827.)</p>

<p>If any vessel or vehicle having such merchandise on board shall
depart from the port of entry without having complied with the provisions
of the preceding section, the master or conductor thereof
shall be liable to a penalty of five hundred dollars. (R. S., 2828.)</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></div>

<h3>Comparison of cargo and manifest.</h3>

<p>The surveyor at the port of delivery shall cause the casks, bags,
boxes, chests, or packages, to be inspected, and compared with the
manifests, and the same being identified he shall grant a permit for
unloading the same, or such part thereof as the master or conductor
shall request; and when a part only of such merchandise is intended
to be landed the surveyor shall make an indorsement on the back
of the manifests, designating such part, specifying the articles to
be landed, and shall return the manifests to the master or conductor,
indorsing thereon his permission to such vessel or vehicle to proceed
to the place of its destination. (R. S., 2830.)</p>

<h3>Illegal unlading.</h3>

<p>If after the arrival of any vessel laden with merchandise and bound
to the United States, within the limits of any collection-district,
or within four leagues of the coast, any part of the cargo of such
vessel shall be unladen, for any purpose whatever, before such vessel
has come to the proper place for the discharge of her cargo, or some
part thereof, and has been there duly authorized by the proper
officer of the customs to unlade the same, the master of such vessel
and the mate, or other person next in command, shall respectively
be liable to a penalty of one thousand dollars for each such offense,
and the merchandise so unladen shall be forfeited, except in case of
some unavoidable accident, necessity, or distress of weather. In
case of such unavoidable accident, necessity, or distress, the master
of such vessel shall give notice to, and, together with two or more
of the officers or mariners on board such vessel, of whom the mate
or other person next in command shall be one, shall make proof upon
oath before the collector, or other chief officer of the customs of the
district, within the limits of which such accident, necessity, of distress
happened, or before the collector, or other chief officer to the
collection-district, within the limits of which such vessel shall first
afterward arrive, if the accident, necessity, or distress happened
not within the limits of any district, but within four leagues of the
coast of the United States. The collector, or other chief officer, is
hereby authorized and required to administer such oath. (R. S.,
2867.)</p>

<p>If any merchandise, so unladen from on board any such vessel,
shall be put or received into any other vessel, except in the case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
such accident, necessity, or distress, to be so notified and proved,
the master of any such vessel into which the merchandise shall be
so put and received, and every other person aiding and assisting
therein, shall be liable to a penalty of treble the value of the merchandise,
and the vessel in which they shall be so put shall be forfeited.
(R. S., 2868.)</p>

<h3>Special permit to unlade by night and preliminary entry.</h3>

<p>Upon arrival at any port in the United States of any vessel or
other conveyance from a foreign port or place, either directly or by
way of another port in the United States, or upon such arrival from
another port in the United States of any vessel or other conveyance
belonging to a line designated by the Secretary of the Treasury
as a common carrier of bonded merchandise, and, after due report
and entry of such vessel in accordance with existing law or due
report, under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may
prescribe, of the arrival of such other conveyances, the collector of
customs, with the concurrence of the naval officer at ports where
there is a naval officer, shall grant, upon proper application therefor,
a special license to lade or unlade the cargo of any such vessel or
other conveyance at night; that is to say, between sunset and sunrise.
(Sec. 1.)</p>

<p>The master of any vessel from a foreign port or place, upon
arrival within a customs collection district of the United States,
bound to a port of entry in such district, may make preliminary
entry of the vessel by making oath or affirmation to the truth of the
statements contained in his original manifest and delivering his said
original manifest to the customs officer who shall board such vessel
within such district, with a copy of said original manifest for the
use of the naval officer at ports where there is a naval officer; whereupon,
upon arrival at the wharf or place of discharge, the lading or
unlading of the cargo of such vessel may proceed, by both day and
night, under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may
prescribe. (Sec. 2.)</p>

<p>Before any such special license to lade or unlade at night shall
be granted and before any permit shall be issued for the immediate
lading or unlading of any such vessel after preliminary entry, as hereinbefore
provided, either by day or by night the master, owner, agent,
or consignee of such vessel or other conveyance shall make proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
application therefor and shall at the same time execute and deliver
to the United States, through the collector of customs, a good and
sufficient bond, in a penal sum to be approved by the said collector,
conditioned to indemnify and save the United States harmless from
any and all losses and liabilities which may occur or be occasioned
by reason of the granting of such special license or the issuing or
granting of such permit for immediate lading or unlading; or the
master, owner, agent, consignee, or probable consignee, as aforesaid,
may execute and deliver to the United States, in like manner
and form, a good and sufficient bond, in the panel sum of fifty
thousand dollars, conditioned to indemnify and save the United
States harmless from any and all losses and liabilities which may occur
or be occasioned by reason of the granting of such special licenses and
the issuing or granting of such permits for immediate lading or
unlading by day and night during a period of six months. (Sec. 3.)</p>

<p>Such application having been duly made and the required bond
having been duly executed and delivered, special license or licenses
to lade or unlade at night after regular entry of vessels, and due
report of other conveyances, may be granted, and a permit or permits
may be issued for the immediate lading and unlading, by day
and night, of vessels admitted to preliminary entry, or of other
conveyances of which due report of arrival has been made: <i>Provided</i>,
That the provisions of this Act shall extend and be applicable
to any vessels or other conveyances bound to a port of entry in the
United States to be unladen at a port of delivery or to be unladen
at a place of discharge designated by the Secretary of the Treasury
under the provisions of section twenty-seven hundred and seventy-six
of the Revised Statutes as amended: <i>Provided further</i>, That when
preliminary entry of a vessel shall be made by the master as herein
provided he shall not be relieved from making due report and entry
of his vessel at the custom-house in accordance with existing law, and
any liability of the master or owner of any such vessel to the owner
or consignee of any merchandise landed from her shall not be affected
by the granting of such special license, but such liability shall continue
until the merchandise is properly removed from the dock
whereon the same may be landed. (Sec. 4.)</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury shall fix a reasonable rate of extra
compensation for night services of inspectors, storekeepers, weighers
and other customs officers and employees in connection with the lading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
or unlading of cargo at night, or the lading at night of cargo or
merchandise for transportation in bond or for exportation in bond,
or for the exportation with benefit of drawback, but such rate of compensation
shall not exceed an amount equal to double the rate of compensation
allowed to each such officer or employee for like services
rendered by day, the said extra compensation to be paid by the
master, owner, agent, or consignee of such vessel or other conveyance,
whenever such special license or permit for immediate lading
or unlading or for lading or unlading at night or on Sundays or holidays
shall be granted, to the collector of customs, who shall pay the
same to the several customs officers and employees entitled thereto
according to the rates fixed therefor by the Secretary of the
Treasury. Customs officers acting as boarding officers, and any
customs officer who may be designated for that purpose by the collector
of customs, and hereby authorized to administer the oath
or affirmation herein provided for, and such boarding officers shall
be allowed extra compensation for services in boarding vessels at
night or on Sundays or holidays—at the rate prescribed by the
Secretary of the Treasury as herein provided, the said extra compensation
to be paid by the master, owner, agent, or consignee of such
vessels. (R. S., 2871; June 30, 1906; Feb. 13, 1911; sec. 5.)</p>

<h3>Unlading by day.</h3>

<p>Except as authorized by the preceding section, no merchandise
brought in any vessel from any foreign port shall be unladen or delivered
from such vessel within the United States but in open day—that
is to say, between the rising and the setting of the sun—except
by special license from the collector of the port, and naval officer
of the same, where there is one, for that purpose, nor at any time
without a permit from the collector, and naval officer, if any, for such
unlading or delivery. (R. S., 2872.)</p>

<p>When the license to unload between the setting and rising of the
sun is granted to a sailing vessel under this section, a fixed, uniform,
and reasonable compensation may be allowed to the inspector or
inspectors for service between the setting and rising of the sun,
under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe,
to be received by the collector from the master, owner, or
consignee of the vessel, and to be paid by him to the inspector or
inspectors. (June 26, 1884; sec. 25.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
If any merchandise shall be unladen or delivered from any vessel
contrary to the preceding section, the master of such vessel, and every
other person who shall knowingly be concerned, or aiding therein,
or in removing, storing, or otherwise securing such merchandise,
shall each be liable to a penalty of four hundred dollars for each
offense, and shall be disabled from holding any office of trust or profit
under the United States, for a term not exceeding seven years;
and the collector of the district shall advertise the name of such
person in a newspaper printed in the State in which he resides, within
twenty days after each respective conviction. (R. S., 2873.)</p>

<p>All merchandise, so unladen or delivered contrary to the provisions
of section twenty-eight hundred and seventy-two, shall become
forfeited, and may be seized by any of the officers of the customs;
and where the value thereof, according to the highest market price
of the same, at the port or district where landed, shall amount to
four hundred dollars, the vessel, tackle, apparel, and furniture shall
be subject to like forfeiture and seizure. (R. S., 2874.)</p>

<h3>Supervision of unlading.</h3>

<p>The collector of any district at which any vessel arrives, immediately
on her first coming within such district, or the surveyor of
any port where such vessel is, may put and keep on board such vessel,
while remaining within such district, or in going from one district
to another, one or more inspectors to examine the cargo or contents
of such vessel, and to superintend the delivery thereof, or of so much
thereof as shall be delivered within the United States, and to perform
such other duties according to law, as they shall be directed by the
collector, or surveyor, to perform for the better securing the collection
of the duties. Only collectors shall have power, however,
to put inspectors on board vessels to go from one district to another.
(R. S., 2875.)</p>

<p>The inspector shall make known to the master of such vessel
the duties he is to perform; and shall suffer no merchandise to be
unladen, or otherwise removed from such vessel, without a permit
in writing from the collector of the port, and naval officer thereof,
if any. The inspector shall enter in a book, to be by him kept according
to such a form as shall be prescribed or approved by the collector,
the name of the person in whose behalf such permits are granted,
together with the particulars therein specified, and the marks, numbers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
kinds, and description of the respective packages which shall
be unladen pursuant thereto, and shall keep a like account in the
book of all merchandise which, not having been entered within the
time limited by this Title [R. S., 2517-3129], or for some other cause,
has been sent to the store or warehouse provided for the reception
of such merchandise; such book shall be delivered to the surveyor
in the month of January in every year for his inspection, and immediately
after such inspection be transmitted by the surveyor, with such
observations as he may think necessary thereon, to the collector,
to be deposited in his office. (R. S., 2876.)</p>

<p>The inspector shall attend to the delivery of the cargo under his
care, at all times when the unlading or delivery of merchandise is
lawful, particularly from the rising to the setting of the sun on each
day, Sundays and the fourth day of July in each year excepted; for
which purpose he shall constantly attend and remain on board the
vessel, the deliveries from which he is to superintend, or at any other
station where his inspection is necessary. The inspector shall not
quit such station or place without the leave of the surveyor of the
port first obtained, who shall appoint another inspector, if he deems
it necessary, to supply the place of such inspector during his absence;
and any inspector who shall neglect or in any manner act contrary
to the duties hereby enjoined, shall for the first offense be liable to
a penalty of the sum of fifty dollars, and for the second offense shall
be displaced, and be incapable of holding any station of trust or profit
under the revenue laws of the United States, for a term not exceeding
seven years. (R. S., 2877.)</p>

<p>No inspector shall perform any other duties or service on board
any vessel, the superintendence of which is committed to him for
any person whatever, other than what is required by this Title [R. S.,
2517-3129], under the penalty of being disabled from acting any
longer as an inspector of the customs; the wages or compensation
of such inspector as may proceed from one district to another, shall
be defrayed by the master of the vessel committed to his care; every
inspector or other officer of the revenue, while performing any duty
on board any vessel, not in a port of the United States, discharging
her cargo, shall be entitled to receive from the master of such vessel
such provisions and accommodations as are usually supplied to
passengers, or as the state and condition of such vessel will admit,
on receiving therefor fifty cents a day; and any master of any vessel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
who shall refuse such provisions and reasonable accommodations
shall be liable to a penalty of one hundred dollars. (R. S., 2878.)</p>

<p>If, by reason of the delivery of the cargo in several districts,
more than the term allowed by law shall in the whole be spent therein,
the wages or compensation of the inspector who may be employed
on board of any vessel, in respect to which such term may be so exceeded,
shall, for every day of such excess, be paid by the master or
owner; and the inspector shall, previously to the clearance of the
vessel, render an exact account to the collector of all such compensation
as has been paid, or is due and payable by the master or owner.
(R. S., 2879.)</p>

<p>The inspector who may be put on board of any vessel shall secure,
after sunset in each evening, or previous to his quitting the vessel,
the hatches and other communications with the hold of such vessel,
or any other part thereof he may judge necessary, with locks or other
proper fastenings, which locks or other fastenings shall not be
opened, broken, or removed until the morning following, or after
the rising of the sun, and in the presence of the inspector by whom
the same were affixed, except by special license from the collector
of the port, and the naval officer, if any, first obtained. If the
locks or other fastenings, or any of them, are broken or removed
contrary to this section, or, if any merchandise or packages are
clandestinely landed, notice thereof shall be immediately given by
the inspector to the collector and naval officer, if any, of the port
where the vessel may be; and the master of such vessel shall, for each
or every such offense, be liable to a penalty of five hundred dollars.
(R. S., 3070.)</p>

<p>Merchandise shall not be entered or delivered from customs
custody elsewhere than at one of the ports of entry hereinbefore designated,
except at the expense of the parties in interest, upon express
authority from the Secretary of the Treasury and under conditions
to be prescribed by him. When it shall be made to appear to the
Secretary of the Treasury that the interests of commerce or the
protection of the revenues so require, he may cause to be stationed
at places in the various collection districts, though not named as ports
of entry, officers or employees of the customs with authority to
enter and clear vessels, to accept entries of merchandise, to collect
duties, and to enforce the various provisions of the customs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
navigation laws. (See Appendix A.) (Executive order; Mar. 3,
1913.)</p>

<h3>Limit of time for unlading.</h3>

<p>Whenever any merchandise shall be imported into any port of
the United States from any foreign port, in any vessel, at the expiration
of ten working days if the vessel is less than five hundred tons
register, and within fifteen working days if it is of five hundred tons
register and less than one thousand, and within twenty working
days if it is of one thousand tons register and less than fifteen hundred,
and within twenty-five working days if it is of fifteen hundred tons
register and upward, not including legal holidays and days when the
condition of the weather prevents the unlading of the vessel with
safety to its cargo, after the time within which the report of the
master of any vessel is required to be made to the collector of the
district, if there is found any merchandise other than has been reported
for some other district or some foreign port, the collector shall
take possession thereof; but with the consent of the owner or consignee
of any merchandise, or with the consent of the owner or
master of the vessel in which the same may be imported, the merchandise
may be taken possession of by the collector after one day's
notice to the collector of the district. All merchandise so taken
shall be delivered pursuant to the order of the collector of the district,
for which a certificate or receipt shall be granted. (R. S., 2880;
May 9, 1896.)</p>

<p>The limitation of time for unlading, prescribed by the preceding
section, shall not extend to vessels laden exclusively with coal, salt,
sugar, hides, dyewoods, wool, or jute butts, consigned to one consignee,
arriving at a port for orders; but if the master of any such
vessel requires a longer time to discharge her cargo, the wages or
compensation of the inspector, for every day's attendance exceeding
the number of days allowed by law, shall be paid by the master or
owner; and thereupon the collector is hereby authorized and required
to allow such longer time, not exceeding fifteen days. (R. S., 2881;
June 3, 1892; sec. 2.)</p>

<p>All merchandise of which the collector shall take possession under
the provisions relating to the time for the discharge of a vessel's
cargo shall be kept with due and reasonable care at the charge and
risk of the owner. (R. S., 2969.)</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></div>

<h3>Post entry.</h3>

<p>If any package whatever which has been so reported is wanting,
and not found on board such vessel, or if the merchandise on board
such vessel does not otherwise agree with the report or manifest
delivered by the master of any such vessel, in every such case the
master shall be liable to a penalty of five hundred dollars; except
that if it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the collector, naval
officer, and surveyor, or to the major part of them where those officers
are established at any port, or to the satisfaction of the collector
alone where neither of the others is established, or in case of trial
for the penalty, to the satisfaction of the court, that no part whatever
of merchandise of such vessel has been unshipped, landed,
or unladen since it was taken on board, except as specified in the
report or manifest, and pursuant to permits, or that the disagreement
is by accident or mistake, in such case the penalty shall not be
inflicted. But in all such cases the master of any vessel shall be
required and shall make a post entry or addition to the report or
manifest by him delivered of any and all merchandise omitted to
be included and reported in such manifest; and it shall not be lawful
to grant a permit to unlade any such merchandise so omitted before
such post entry or addition to such report or manifest has been
made. (R. S., 2887.)</p>

<h3>Returns of unlading of cargo.</h3>

<p>When the delivery of merchandise from on board of any vessel
is completed, copies of the accounts or entries which have been kept
or made thereof, by the officer charged with the deliveries, shall be
returned to the collector of the district, and the naval officer, if any,
within three days after such delivery has been completed, if at the
port where such officer resides, and if at any other port as soon as the
nature of the case will admit, not exceeding fifteen days. The
accounts or entries to be so returned shall comprise all deliveries
made pursuant to permits, and all packages or merchandise sent to
the public stores; also each and every package remaining on board
of such vessel for the purpose of being exported therein to a foreign
port, or to some other district of the United States. (R. S., 2888.)</p>

<p>Such returns shall be signed by the inspectors respectively under
whose superintendence the deliveries have been made; and, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
examination, and on being found correct, shall be countersigned or
certified by the surveyor of the port, if any, at the port where the
deliveries have been made. The returns shall be transmitted by
him to the naval officer, if any; who shall compare the same with the
manifests and entries in his possession; and if any difference appears,
the particulars thereof shall be noted by indorsement on the returns;
and if no difference appears, it shall be so noted by like indorsements.
The naval officer shall transmit the returns to the collector
of the district; and on being returned to the collector, shall be by
him compared with the manifests and entries of the merchandise,
which have been made by the owner, consignee, or his factor or agent;
and if any difference appears, the same shall be noted by indorsement
on such manifests, specifying the particulars thereof; and if
no difference appears, it shall be noted by like indorsement, that
the delivery corresponds with the entry or entries thereof. The
indorsement or memorandum shall, in each case, be subscribed by
the officer by whom the comparison was made. (R. S., 2889.)</p>

<h3>Vessels in distress.</h3>

<p>If any vessel from any foreign port, compelled by distress of
weather, or other necessity, shall put into any port of the United
States, not being destined for the same, the master, together with the
mate or person next in command, may, within twenty-four hours
after her arrival, make protest in the usual form upon oath, before a
notary public or other person duly authorized, or before the collector
of the district where the vessel arrives, setting forth the cause
or circumstances of such distress or necessity. Such protest, if not
made before the collector, shall be produced to him, and to the naval
officer, if any, and a copy thereof lodged with him or them. The
master shall also, within forty-eight hours after such arrival, make
report in writing to the collector, of the vessel and her cargo, as is
directed hereby to be done in other cases. And if it appear to the
collector, by the certificate of the wardens of the port, or other
officers usually charged with, and accustomed to ascertain the condition
of vessels arriving in distress, if any, or by the certificate of
two reputable merchants, to be named for that purpose by the collector,
if there are no such wardens, or other officers duly qualified,
that there is a necessity for unlading the vessel, the collector and naval
officer, if any, shall grant a permit for that purpose, and shall appoint
an inspector to oversee such unlading, who shall keep an account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
of the same, to be compared with the report made by the master of
the vessel. (R. S., 2891.)</p>

<p>All merchandise so unladen from any vessel arriving in distress
shall be stored under the direction of the collector, who, upon request
of the master of such vessel, or of the owner thereof, shall, together
with the naval officer, where there is one, and alone where there is
none, grant permission to dispose of such part of the cargo as may be
of a perishable nature, if any there be, or as may be necessary to
defray the expenses attending such vessel and her cargo. But
entry shall be made therefor, and the duties paid. (R. S., 2892.)</p>

<p>In case the delivery of the cargo does not agree with the report
thereof, made by the master of such vessel so arriving in distress,
and if the difference or disagreement is not satisfactorily accounted
for in manner prescribed by this Title [R. S., 2517-3129], the master
of such vessel shall be liable to such penalties as in other like cases
are prescribed. (R. S., 2893.)</p>

<p>The merchandise, or the remainder thereof, which shall not be
disposed of, may be reladen on board the vessel so arriving in distress,
under the inspection of the officer who superintended the landing
thereof, or other proper person; and the vessel may proceed with
the same to the place of her destination, free from any other charge
than for the storing and safe-keeping of the merchandise, and fees
to the officers of the customs as in other cases. (R. S., 2894.)</p>

<h3>Obstruction by ice.</h3>

<p>When a vessel is prevented by ice from getting to the port or
place at which her cargo is intended to be delivered, the collector of
the district in which such vessel may be obstructed may receive the
report and entry of such vessel, and, with the consent of the naval
officer, where there is one, grant permits for unlading or landing the
merchandise imported in such vessel, at any place within his district,
most convenient and proper. The report and entry of such vessel, and
her cargo, or any part thereof, and all persons concerned therein,
shall be subject to the same regulations and penalties as if the vessel
had arrived at the port of her destination, and had there proceeded
to the delivery of her cargo. (R. S., 2896.)</p>

<h3>Salvage of merchandise.</h3>

<p>All merchandise imported into the United States shall, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
purpose of this title [R. S., 2517-3129] be deemed and held to be the
property of the person to whom the merchandise may be consigned;
but the holder of any bill of lading consigned to order and endorsed
by the consignor shall be deemed the consignee thereof.</p>

<p>And in case of the abandonment of any merchandise to the
underwriters, the latter may be recognized as the consignee, and under
such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe, merchandise
saved from a vessel wrecked or abandoned at sea, or on or
along the coasts of the United States and promptly brought into a
port of the United States by or in possession of the salvors of the
same, can, for the purpose of its title, be regarded as the property
of such salvors, and the valuation thereof and payment of duties
thereon can be made accordingly and with due reference to the condition
of said merchandise as thus saved and the necessities of the
case:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>Provided, however</i>, That such bringing in by salvors shall be in
good faith and without intent to evade the just payment of duty:</p>

<p><i>And provided further</i>, That nothing herein contained shall be so
construed as to prejudice in any other respect the rights of property,
or of or through abandonment or allowance of the owner or any
other person interested in said merchandise. (R. S., 3058; Feb.
23, 1887.)</p>

</div>

<h3>Fraudulent importation of merchandise.</h3>

<p>If any person shall fraudulently or knowingly import or bring
into the United States, or assist in so doing any merchandise, contrary
to law, or shall receive, conceal, buy, sell, or in any manner
facilitate the transportation, concealment, or sale of such merchandise
after importation, knowing the same to have been imported contrary
to law, such merchandise shall be forfeited and the offender shall be
fined in any sum not exceeding five thousand dollars nor less than
fifty dollars, or be imprisoned for any time not exceeding two years,
or both. Whenever, on trial for a violation of this section, the
defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of such goods,
such possession shall be deemed evidence sufficient to authorize
conviction, unless the defendant shall explain the possession to the
satisfaction of the jury. (R. S., 3082.)</p>

<h3>Bribery and solicitation of bribes.</h3>

<p>Any person who shall give, or offer to give or promise to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
any money or thing of value, directly or indirectly, to any officer
or employee of the United States in consideration of or for any act
or omission contrary to law in connection with or pertaining to the
importation, appraisement, entry, examination, or inspection of
goods, wares, or merchandise, including herein any baggage, or
of the liquidation of the entry thereof, or shall by threats or demands,
or promises of any character attempt to improperly influence or
control any such officer or employee of the United States as to the
performance of his official duties shall, on conviction thereof, be fined
not exceeding two thousand dollars, or be imprisoned at hard labor
not more than one year, or both, in the discretion of the court;
and evidence of such giving, or offering, or promising to give, satisfactory
to the court in which such trial is had, shall be regarded as
prima facie evidence that such giving or offering or promising was
contrary to law, and shall put upon the accused the burden of proving
that such act was innocent, and not done with an unlawful intention.
(June 10, 1890; sec. 26; Oct. 3, 1913, sec. III, AA.)</p>

<p>Any officer or employee of the United States who shall, excepting
for lawful duties or fees, solicit, demand, exact or receive from any
person, directly or indirectly, any money or thing of value, in connection
with or pertaining to the importation, appraisement, entry,
examination, or inspection of goods, wares, or merchandise, including
herein any baggage, or liquidation of the entry thereof, on conviction
thereof, shall be fined not exceeding five thousand dollars, or
be imprisoned at hard labor not more than two years, or both, in the
discretion of the court. And evidence of such soliciting, demanding,
exacting, or receiving, satisfactory to the court in which such trial
is had, shall be regarded as prima facie evidence that such soliciting,
demanding, exacting, or receiving was contrary to law, and shall put
upon the accused the burden of proving that such act was innocent
and not with an unlawful intention. (June 10, 1890; sec. 27; Oct.

<h3>Liens for freight or general average.</h3>

<p>Whenever the collector of the port of entry of the vessel, or other
proper officer of the customs, shall be duly notified in writing of the
existence of a lien for freight, charges, or contribution in general
average upon imported goods, wares, or merchandise in his custody,
he shall, before delivering such goods, wares, or merchandise to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
importer, owner, or consignee thereof for consumption, or to any
vessel or vehicle for transportation or exportation, give seasonable
notice to the party or parties claiming the lien; and the possession
by the officers of customs shall not affect the discharge of such lien,
under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe;
and such officer shall refuse the delivery of such merchandise
from any public or bonded warehouse or other place in which the
same shall be deposited until proof to his satisfaction shall be produced
that the freight, charges, or contribution in general average
thereon has been paid or secured; but the rights of the United States
shall not be prejudiced thereby, nor shall the United States or its
officers be in any manner liable for losses consequent upon such refusal
to deliver. If merchandise so subject to a lien, regarding which notice
has been filed, shall be forfeited to the United States and sold, the
freight, charges, or contribution in general average due thereon
shall be paid from the proceeds of such sale in the same manner as
other charges and expenses authorized by law to be paid therefrom
are paid. (R. S., 2981; May 21, 1896.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
LIABILITY OF OWNERS, MASTERS, AND SHIPPERS</h2>

<h3>Liability of Owners, Masters and Shippers.</h3>

<p>If any shipper of platina, gold, gold dust, silver, bullion, or other
precious metals, coins, jewelry, bills of any bank or public body,
diamonds, or other precious stones, or any gold or silver in a manufactured
or unmanufactured state, watches, clocks, or time pieces
of any description, trinkets, orders, notes, or securities for payment
of money, stamps, maps, writings, title-deeds, printings, engravings,
pictures, gold or silver plate or plated articles, glass, china, silks in
a manufactured or unmanufactured state, and whether wrought up
or not wrought up with any other material, furs, or lace, or any of
them, contained in any parcel, or package, or trunk, shall lade the
same as freight or baggage, on any vessel, without at the time of
such lading giving to the master, clerk, agent, or owner of such
vessel receiving the same a written notice of the true character and
value thereof, and having the same entered on the bill of lading
therefor, the master and owner of such vessel shall not be liable as
carriers thereof in any form or manner; nor shall any such master or
owner be liable for any such goods beyond the value and according to
the character thereof so notified and entered. (R. S., 4281.)</p>

<p>No owner of any vessel shall be liable to answer for or make good
to any person any loss or damage which may happen to any merchandise
whatsoever, which shall be shipped, taken in, or put on board
any such vessel, by reason or by means of any fire happening to or on
board the vessel, unless such fire is caused by the design or neglect
of such owner. (R. S., 4282.)</p>

<p>The liability of the owner of any vessel, for any embezzlement, loss,
or destruction, by any person, of any property, goods, or merchandise,
shipped or put on board of such vessel, or for any loss, damage,
or injury by collision, or for any act, matter, or thing, lost, damage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
or forfeiture, done, occasioned, or incurred, without the privity or
knowledge of such owner or owners, shall in no case exceed the amount
or value of the interest of such owner in such vessel, and her freight
then pending. (R. S., 4283.)</p>

<p>Whenever any such embezzlement, loss, or destruction is suffered
by several freighters or owners of goods, wares, merchandise,
or any property whatever, on the same voyage, and the whole value
of the vessel, and her freight for the voyage, is not sufficient to make
compensation to each of them, they shall receive compensation from
the owner of the vessel, in proportion to their respective losses; and
for that purpose the freighters and owners of the property, and the
owner of the vessel, or any of them, may take the appropriate proceedings
in any court, for the purpose of apportioning the sum for
which the owner of the vessel may be liable among the parties entitled
thereto. (R. S., 4284.)</p>

<p>It shall be deemed a sufficient compliance on the part of such
owner with the requirements of this Title [R. S., 4131-4305] relating
to his liability for any embezzlement, loss, or destruction of any
property, goods, or merchandise, if he shall transfer his interest in
such vessel and freight, for the benefit of such claimants, to a trustee,
to be appointed by any court of competent jurisdiction, to act as such
trustee for the person who may prove to be legally entitled thereto;
from and after which transfer all claims and proceedings against the
owner shall cease. (R. S., 4285.)</p>

<p>The charterer of any vessel, in case he shall man, victual, and
navigate such vessel at his own expense, or by his own procurement,
shall be deemed the owner of such vessel within the meaning of the
provisions of this Title [R. S., 4131-4305] relating to the limitation
of the liability of the owners of vessels; and such vessel, when so
chartered, shall be liable in the same manner as if navigated by the
owner thereof. (R. S., 4286.)</p>

<p>Nothing in the five preceding sections shall be construed to take
away or affect the remedy to which any party may be entitled, against
the master, officers, or seamen, for or on account of any embezzlement,
injury, loss, or destruction of merchandise, or property, put on
board any vessel, or on account of any negligence, fraud, or other
malversation of such master, officers, or seamen, respectively, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
to lessen or take away any responsibility to which any master or
seaman of any vessel may by law be liable, notwithstanding such
master or seaman may be an owner or part owner of the vessel.
(R. S., 4287.)</p>

<p>Any person shipping oil of vitrol, unslaked lime, inflammable
matches, or gunpowder, in a vessel taking cargo for divers persons
on freight, without delivering, at the time of shipment, a note in
writing, expressing the nature and character of such merchandise,
to the master, mate, officer, or person in charge of the lading of the
vessel, shall be liable to the United States in a penalty of one thousand
dollars. (R. S., 4288; June, 19, 1886; sec. 4.)</p>

<p>The individual liability of a shipowner shall be limited to the
proportion of any or all debts and liabilities that his individual share
of the vessel bears to the whole; and the aggregate liabilities of all
the owners of a vessel on account of the same shall not exceed the
value of such vessel and freight pending: <i>Provided</i>, That this provision
shall not affect the liability of any owner incurred previous
to the passage of this act, nor prevent any claimant from joining all
the owners in one action; nor shall the same apply to wages due to
persons employed by said shipowners. (June 26, 1884; sec. 18.)</p>

<p>The provisions of the seven preceding sections, and of section
eighteen of an act entitled "An act to remove certain burdens on the
American merchant marine and encourage the American foreign
carrying-trade, and for other purposes," approved June twenty-sixth,
eighteen hundred and eighty-four, relating to the limitations of the
liability of the owners of vessels, shall apply to all seagoing vessels,
and also to all vessels used on lakes or rivers or in inland navigation,
including canal-boats, barges, and lighters. (R. S., 4289;
June 19, 1886; sec. 4.)</p>

<h3>Act of February 13, 1893 (Harter Act).</h3>

<p>It shall not be lawful for the manager, agent, master or owner
of any vessel transporting merchandise or property from or between
ports of the United States and foreign ports to insert in any bill of
lading or shipping document any clause, covenant, or agreement
whereby it, he, or they shall be relieved from liability for loss or
damage arising from negligence, fault, or failure in proper loading,
stowage, custody, care, or proper delivery of any and all lawful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
merchandise or property committed to its or their charge. Any
and all words or clauses of such import inserted in bills of lading or
shipping receipts shall be null and void and of no effect. (Sec. 1.)</p>

<p>It shall not be lawful for any vessel transporting merchandise
or property from or between ports of the United States of America
and foreign ports, her owner, master, agent or manager to insert in
any bill of lading or shipping document any covenant or agreement
whereby the obligations of the owner or owners of said vessel to
exercise due diligence, properly equip, man, provision, and outfit
said vessel, and to make said vessel seaworthy and capable of performing
her intended voyage, or whereby the obligations of the master,
officers, agents, or servants to carefully handle and stow her
cargo and to care for and properly deliver same, shall in any wise
be lessened, weakened, or avoided. (Sec. 2.)</p>

<p>If the owner of any vessel transporting merchandise or property
to or from any port in the United States of America shall exercise
due diligence to make the said vessel in all respects seaworthy and
properly manned, equipped, and supplied, neither the vessel, or
owners, agent, or charterers shall become or be held responsible
for damage or loss resulting from faults or errors in navigation or
in the management of said vessel, nor shall the vessel, her owner or
owners, charterers, agent, or master, be held liable for losses arising
from dangers of the sea or other navigable waters, acts of God, or
public enemies, or the inherent defect, quality, or vice of the thing
carried, or from insufficiency of package, or seizure under legal process,
or for loss resulting from any act or omission of the shipper or
owner of the goods, his agent or representative, or from saving or
attempting to save life or property at sea, or from any deviation in
rendering such service. (Sec. 3.)</p>

<p>It shall be the duty of the owner or owners, masters, or agent
of any vessel transporting merchandise or property from or between
ports of the United States and foreign ports to issue to shippers of
any lawful merchandise a bill of lading, or shipping document, stating,
among other things, the marks necessary for identification,
number of packages, or quantity, stating whether it be carrier's or
shipper's weight, and apparent order or condition of such merchandise
or property delivered to and received by the owner, master, or
agent of the vessel for transportation, and such document shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
prima facie evidence of the receipt of the merchandise therein described.
(Sec. 4.)</p>

<p>For a violation of any of the provisions of this act the agent,
owner, or master of the vessel guilty of such violation, and who refuses
to issue on demand the bill of lading herein provided for, shall be
liable to a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars. The amount
of the fine and costs for such violation shall be a lien upon the vessel,
whose agent, owner, or master is guilty of such violation, and such
vessel may be libeled therefor in any district court of the United
States, within whose jurisdiction the vessel may be found. One-half
of such penalty shall go to the party injured by such violation
and the remainder to the Government of the United States.
(Sec. 5.)</p>

<p>This act shall not be held to modify or repeal sections forty-two
hundred and eighty-one, forty-two hundred and eighty-two, and forty-two
hundred and eighty-three of the Revised Statutes of the United
States, or any other statute defining the liability of vessels, their
owners, or representatives. (Sec. 6.)</p>

<p>Sections one and four of this act shall not apply to the transportation
of live animals. (Feb. 13, 1893; sec. 7.)</p>

<h3>General libel bond.</h3>

<p>When a warrant of arrest or other process in rem is issued in any
cause of admiralty jurisdiction, except in cases of seizures for forfeiture
under any law of the United States, the marshal shall stay
the execution of such process, or discharge the property arrested if
the process has been levied, on receiving from the claimant of the
property a bond or stipulation in double the amount claimed by the
libelant, with sufficient surety, to be approved by the judge of the
court where the cause is pending, or, in his absence, by the collector
of the port, conditioned to answer the decree of the court in such
cause. Such bond or stipulation shall be returned to the court,
and judgment thereon, against both the principal and sureties, may
be recovered at the time of rendering the decree in the original
cause. And the owner of any vessel may cause to be executed and
delivered to the marshal a bond or stipulation, with sufficient surety,
to be approved by the judge of the court in which he is marshal,
conditioned to answer the decree of said court in all or any cases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
that shall thereafter be brought in said court against the said vessel,
and thereupon the execution of all such process against said vessel
shall be stayed so long as the amount secured by such bond or stipulation
shall be at least double the aggregate amount claimed by the
libelants in such suits which shall be begun and pending against
said vessel; and like judgments and remedies may be had on said
bond or stipulation as if a special bond or stipulation had been filed
in each of said suits. The court may make such orders as may be
necessary to carry this section into effect, and especially for the
giving of proper notice of any such suit. Such bond or stipulation
shall be indorsed by the clerk with a minute of the suits wherein
process is so stayed, and further security may at any time be required
by the court. If a special bond or stipulation in the particular cause
shall be given under this section, the liability as to said cause on the
general bond or stipulation shall cease. (R. S., 941; Mar. 3, 1899.)</p>

<h3>Export of arms to American countries.</h3>

<p>Whenever the President shall find that in any American country
conditions of domestic violence exist which are promoted by the use

any arms or munitions of war from any place in the United
States to such country until otherwise ordered by the President or by
Congress.</p>

<p>Any shipment of material hereby declared unlawful after such

<h3>Exemption of private property at sea.</h3>

<p>It is the sense of the Congress of the United States that it is
desirable, in the interest of uniformity of action by the maritime
states of the world in time of war, that the President endeavor to
bring about an understanding among the principal maritime powers
with a view of incorporating into the permanent law of civilized
nations the principle of the exemption of all private property at
sea, not contraband of war, from capture or destruction by belligerents.
(J. Res., Apr. 28, 1904.)</p>

receiving such assistance or salvage services. (Sec. 1.)</p>

<p>The master or person in charge of a vessel shall, so far as he can
do so without serious danger to his own vessel, crew, or passengers,
render assistance to every person who is found at sea in danger of
being lost; and if he fails to do so, he shall, upon conviction, be
liable to a penalty of not exceeding one thousand dollars or imprisonment
for a term not exceeding two years, or both. (Sec. 2.)</p>

<p>Salvors of human life, who have taken part in the services rendered
on the occasion of the accident giving rise to salvage, are
entitled to a fair share of the remuneration awarded to the salvors
of the vessel, her cargo, and accessories. (Sec. 3.)</p>

<p>A suit for the recovery of remuneration for rendering assistance
or salvage services shall not be maintainable if brought later than two
years from the date when such assistance or salvage was rendered,
unless the court in which the suit is brought shall be satisfied that
during such period there had not been any reasonable opportunity
of arresting the assisted or salved vessel within the jurisdiction of the
court or within the territorial waters of the country in which the
libelant resides or has his principal place of business. (Sec. 4.)</p>

<p>Nothing in this Act shall be construed as applying to ships of
war or to Government ships appropriated exclusively to a public
service. (Aug. 1, 1912; sec. 5.)</p>

<h3>Protection against fire.</h3>

<p>Every steamer carrying passengers or freight shall be provided
with suitable pipes and valves attached to the boiler to convey
steam into the hold and to the different compartments thereof to
extinguish fire, or such other suitable apparatus as may be prescribed
by the regulations of the board of supervising inspectors, with the
approval of the Secretary of Commerce, for extinguishing fire in
the hold and compartments thereof by the introduction through
pipes into such hold and compartments of carbonic acid gas or other
fire-extinguishing gas or vapor; and every stove used on board of any
such vessel shall be well and securely fastened, so as to prevent it
from being moved or overthrown, and all woodwork or other ignitible
substances about the boilers, chimneys, cook houses, and stove-pipes,
exposed to ignition shall be thoroughly shielded by some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
incombustible material in such a manner as to leave the air to circulate
freely between such material and woodwork or other ignitible
substance; and before granting a certificate of inspection the inspector
shall require all other necessary provisions to be made throughout
such vessels to guard against loss or danger from fire. (R. S.,
4470; Mar. 3, 1905; sec. 7.)</p>

<p>Every steamer permitted by her certificate of inspection to carry
as many as fifty passengers, or upward, and every steamer carrying
passengers, which also carries cotton, hay, or hemp, shall be provided
with a good double-acting steam fire-pump, or other equivalent
apparatus for throwing water. Such pump or other apparatus for
throwing water shall be kept at all times and at all seasons of the year
in good order and ready for immediate use, having at least two pipes
of suitable dimensions, one on each side of the vessel, to convey the
water to the upper decks, to which pipes there shall be attached,
by means of stop-cocks or valves, both between decks and on the
upper deck, good and suitable hose of sufficient strength to stand a
pressure of not less than one hundred pounds to the square inch,
long enough to reach to all parts of the vessel and properly provided
with nozzles, and kept in good order and ready for immediate service.
Every steamer exceeding two hundred tons burden and carrying
passengers shall be provided with two good double-acting fire-pumps,
to be worked by hand; each chamber of such pumps, except
pumps upon steamers in service on the twenty-eighth day of February,
eighteen hundred and seventy-one, shall be of sufficient capacity
to contain not less than one hundred cubic inches of water;
and such pumps shall be placed in the most suitable parts of the vessel
for efficient service, having suitable well-fitted hose to each pump,
of at least one-half the vessel in length, kept at all times in perfect
order, and shipped up and ready for immediate use. On every
steamer not exceeding two hundred tons, one of such pumps may be
dispensed with. Each fire-pump thus prescribed shall be supplied
with water by means of a suitable pipe connected therewith, and
passing through the side of the vessel so low as to be at all times
under water when she is afloat. Every steamer shall also be provided
with a pump which shall be of sufficient strength and suitably arranged
to test the boilers thereof. (R. S., 4471; June 30, 1906.)</p>

<p>Every steamer carrying passengers during the night-time shall
keep a suitable number of watchmen in the cabins, and on each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
deck, to guard against fire or other dangers, and to give alarm in
case of accident or disaster. (R. S., 4477.)</p>

<p>For any neglect to keep the watchmen required by the preceding
section, the license of the officer in charge of the vessel for the time
being shall be revoked; and every owner of such vessel who neglects
or refuses to furnish the number of men necessary to keep watch as
required, shall be fined one thousand dollars. (R. S., 4478.)</p>

<p>The board of supervising inspectors may require steamers carrying
either passengers or freight to be provided with such number and
kind of good and efficient portable fire-extinguishers as, in the judgment
of the board, may be necessary to protect them from fire when
such steamers are moored or lying at a wharf without steam to work
the pumps. (R. S., 4479.)</p>

<p>Every such steam vessel carrying passengers shall keep such fire
buckets, axes, and water barrels as shall be prescribed by the regulations
established by the board of supervising inspectors, with the
approval of the Secretary of Commerce. The buckets and barrels
shall be kept in convenient places and filled with water, to be in readiness
in case of fire, and the axes shall be kept in good order and ready
for immediate use. Tanks of suitable dimensions and arrangement,
or buckets in sufficient number, may be substituted for barrels.
(R. S., 4483; Mar. 3, 1905; sec. 3.)</p>

<h3>Inflammable or explosive cargo.</h3>

<p>Upon the application of any master or owner of any steam vessel
employed in the carriage of passengers, for a license to carry gunpowder,
the local inspectors shall examine such vessel, and if they
find that she is provided with a chest or safe composed of metal,
or entirely lined and sheathed therewith, or if the vessel has one or
more compartments thoroughly lined and sheathed with metal,
at a secure distance from any fire, they may grant a certificate to
that effect, authorizing such vessel to carry as freight within such
chest, safes, or compartments, the article of gunpowder, which certificate
shall be kept conspicuously posted on board such vessel. (R.
S., 4422; Mar. 4, 1915; Sec. 2.)</p>

<p>No loose hay, loose cotton, or loose hemp, camphene, nitro-glycerine,
naphtha, benzine, benzole, coal oil, crude or refined petroleum,
or other like explosive burning fluids, or like dangerous articles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
shall be carried as freight or used as stores on any steamer carrying
passengers; nor shall baled cotton or hemp be carried on such
steamers unless the bales are compactly pressed and thoroughly
covered and secured in such manner as shall be prescribed by the
regulations established by the board of supervising inspectors with
the approval of the Secretary of Commerce; nor shall gunpowder
be carried on any such vessel except under special license; nor shall
oil of vitrol, nitric or other chemical acids be carried on such steamers
except on the decks or guards thereof or in such other safe part of
the vessel as shall be prescribed by the inspectors. Refined petroleum,
which will not ignite at a temperature less than one hundred and ten
degrees of Fahrenheit thermometer, may be carried on board such
steamers upon routes where there is no other practicable mode of
transporting it, and under such regulations as shall be prescribed
by the board of supervising inspectors with the approval of the Secretary
of Commerce; and oil or spirits of turpentine may be carried
on such steamers when put up in good metallic vessels or casks or
barrels well and securely bound with iron and stowed in a secure
part of the vessel; and friction matches may be carried on such
steamers when securely packed in strong, tight chests or boxes, the
covers of which shall be well secured by locks, screws, or other reliable
fastenings, and stowed in a safe part of the vessel at a secure distance
from any fire or heat. All such other provisions shall be made on
every steamer carrying passengers or freight, to guard against
and extinguish fire, as shall be prescribed by the board of supervising
inspectors and approved by the Secretary of Commerce.</p>

<p>Nothing in the foregoing or following sections of this Act shall prohibit
the transportation by steam vessels of gasoline or any of the
products of petroleum when carried by motor vehicles (commonly
known as automobiles) using the same as a source of motive power:
<i>Provided, however</i>, That all fire, if any, in such vehicles or automobiles
be extinguished immediately after entering the said vessel, and that
the same be not relighted until immediately before said vehicle
shall leave the vessel: <i>Provided further</i>, That any owner, master,
agent, or other person having charge of passenger steam vessels
shall have the right to refuse to transport automobile vehicles the
tanks of which contain gasoline, naphtha, or other dangerous burning
fluids. (Mar. 3, 1905; sec. 8.)</p>

<p><i>Provided, however</i>, That nothing in the provisions of this Title
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
shall prohibit the transportation by vessels not carrying passengers
for hire, of gasoline or any of the products of petroleum for use as a
source of motive power for the motor boats or launches of such
vessels. (May 28, 1906.)</p>

<p><i>Provided further</i>, That nothing in the foregoing or following
sections of this Act shall prohibit the use, by steam vessels carrying
passengers for hire, of lifeboats equipped with gasoline motors, and
tanks containing gasoline for the operation of said motor-driven
lifeboats: <i>Provided, however</i>, That no gasoline shall be carried other
than that in the tanks of the lifeboats: <i>Provided further</i>, That the
use of such lifeboats equipped with gasoline motors shall be under
such regulations as shall be prescribed by the board of supervising
inspectors with the approval of the Secretary of Commerce. (Jan.
24, 1913.)</p>

<p><i>Provided, however</i>, That nothing in the foregoing or following
sections of this Act shall prohibit the transportation and use by
vessels carrying passengers or freight for hire of gasoline or any
of the products of petroleum for the operation of engines to supply
an auxiliary lighting and wireless system independent of the vessel's
main power plant: <i>Provided further</i>, That the transportation or use
of such gasoline or any of the products of petroleum shall be under
such regulations as shall be prescribed by the Board of Supervising
Inspectors, with the approval of the Secretary of Commerce. (R. S.,
4472; Oct. 22, 1914.)</p>

<p>Every bale of cotton or hemp that shall be shipped or carried
on any passenger-steamer, without conforming to the provisions of
the preceding section, shall be subject to a penalty of five dollars,
and shall be liable to seizure and sale to secure the payment of such
penalty. (R. S., 4473.)</p>

<p>The Secretary of Commerce may grant permission to the owner
of any steam vessel, to use any invention or process for the utilization
of petroleum or other mineral oils or substances in the production
of motive-power, and may make and enforce regulations concerning
the application and use of the same for such purpose. But no such
permission shall be granted, unless upon the certificate of the supervising
inspector of steamboats for the district wherein such vessel
is registered, and other satisfactory proof that the use of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
is safe and efficient; and upon such proof, and the approval of such
certificate by the Secretary of Commerce, a special license for the
use of such process or invention shall issue under the seal of the
Department of Commerce. (R. S., 4474; Feb. 14, 1903; sec. 10.)</p>

<p>The Secretary of Commerce may permit the use of petroleum
as fuel on steamers not carrying passengers, without the certificate
of the supervising inspector of the district where the vessel is to be
used, subject to such conditions and safeguards as the Secretary of
Commerce in his judgment shall provide. For a violation of any
of the conditions imposed by the Secretary of Commerce a penalty
of five hundred dollars shall be imposed, which penalty shall be a
lien upon the vessel, but a bond may, as provided in other cases, be
given to secure the satisfaction of the judgment. (Oct. 18, 1888;
Feb. 14, 1903; sec. 10.)</p>

<p><i>Provided further</i>, That when crude petroleum of a flash point not
less than one hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit, is carried in the
double-bottom fuel tanks of steamers using the same for fuel, the
crude petroleum carried in such tanks in excess of the necessities
of the voyage may be discharged at terminal ports when no passengers
are on board the ship. Crude petroleum carried and discharged
under these conditions will not be considered stores or cargo within
the contemplation of section forty-four hundred and seventy-two,
Revised Statutes of the United States. (R. S., 4474.)</p>

<p>All gunpowder, nitro-glycerine, camphene, naphtha, benzine,
benzole, coal-oil, crude or refined petroleum, oil of vitriol, nitric or

State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
to but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, on any vessel or
vehicle of any description operated by a common carrier in the transportation
of passengers or articles of commerce by land or water.
(R. S., 4475.)</p>

<p>Every person who packs or puts up, or causes to be packed or
put up for shipment, any gunpowder, nitro-glycerine, camphene, naphtha,
benzine, benzole, coal oil, crude or refined petroleum, oil of vitriol,
nitric or other chemical acids, oil or spirits of turpentine, friction-matches,
or other articles of like character otherwise than as directed
by the preceding section, or who knowingly ships or attempts to ship
the same, or delivers the same to any such vessels as stores unless
duly packed and marked, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
and punished by a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars, or
imprisonment not exceeding eighteen months, or both; one-half
of the fine to go to the informer, and the articles to be liable to seizure
and forfeiture. (R. S., 4476.)</p>

<p>Every package containing explosives or other dangerous articles
when presented to a common carrier for shipment shall have plainly
marked on the outside thereof the contents thereof; and it shall be
unlawful for any person to deliver, or cause to be delivered, to any
common carrier engaged in interstate or foreign commerce by land
or water, for interstate or foreign transportation, or to carry upon any
vessel or vehicle engaged in interstate or foreign transportation, any
explosive, or other dangerous article, under any false or deceptive
marking, description, invoice, shipping order, or other declaration,
or without informing the agent of such carrier of the true character
thereof, at or before the time such delivery or carriage is made.
Whoever shall knowingly violate, or cause to be violated, any provision
of this section, or of the three sections last preceding, or any
regulation made by the Interstate Commerce Commission in pursuance
thereof, shall be fined not more than two thousand dollars,
or imprisoned not more than eighteen months, or both. (Mar. 4,
1909; sec. 235; Repeals R. S., 5353, 5354.)</p>

<p>When the death or bodily injury of any person is caused by
the explosion of any article named in the four sections last preceding,

transportation of passengers for hire: <i>Provided further</i>, That nothing
in this section shall be construed to prevent the transportation of
military or naval forces with their accompanying munitions of war
on passenger equipment vessels or vehicles. (Mar. 4, 1909; Repeals
R S., 5353 and 5354; sec. 232.)</p>

<p>The Interstate Commerce Commission shall formulate regulations
for the safe transportation of explosives, which shall be binding
upon all common carriers engaged in interstate or foreign commerce
which transport explosives by land. Said commission, of its own
motion, or upon application made by any interested party, may
make changes or modifications in such regulations, made desirable
by new information or altered conditions. Such regulations shall be
in accord with the best known practicable means for securing safety
in transit, covering the packing, marking, loading, handling while
in transit, and the precautions necessary to determine whether the
material when offered is in proper condition to transport. Such
regulations, as well as all changes or modifications thereof, shall
take effect ninety days after their formulation and publication by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
said commission and shall be in effect until reversed, set aside, or

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
THE CHIEF MATE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Chief Officer of an ocean steamer is officially styled
the Chief Mate. Also, he is often referred to simply as
the Mate. In passenger liners, transports, and the like, the
term Chief Officer, finds favor. But among men of the sea,
the fine old sailor title "Chief Mate" prevails.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate has the most difficult, and in many
ways, the most important position on a vessel. An energetic
Chief Mate, who is also competent, makes his vessel a successful
organization. He should possess the necessary knowledge
and skill in his profession, combined with initiative,
tact, and executive ability of a high order.</p>

<p>The position of Chief Mate is the test job of the sea.
An indifferent junior officer can survive for years, but when
he is appointed Chief Mate, he must either make good, and
achieve promotion, or his faults and shortcomings overtake
him and ruin his career. This is the hard screen through
which the master mariners are sifted.</p>

<p><b>Next to Master.</b> The Chief Mate is next in authority
to the Master, and acts in his place during his absence.
If the Master dies while the vessel is at sea, the Chief Mate
assumes command, and is vested with all of the authority
and responsibilities of that station, subject to the pleasure
of the owners upon the arrival of the vessel in port.</p>

<p><b>He Reports for Duty.</b> Upon receiving his appointment
to a vessel as Chief Mate, it is the duty of that officer to
report on board and present his credentials to the Master
without delay. He should be ready to take up his duties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
at once, settling all of his private affairs before going on
board.</p>

<p>He should carry out any special orders that the Master
may give.</p>

<p><b>Vessel in the Stream.</b> If the vessel is in the stream the
new Chief Mate should note the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>1. Locate vessel on chart.</p>

<p>2. Verify depth of water and character of bottom.</p>

<p>3. How much chain out—what anchor? Is chain locked
on windlass, or on riding chocks?</p>

<p>4. If moored, either bow or stern, inspect mooring wires;
trappings; etc., see to means for slipping and hauling in.</p>

<p>5. Is the anchorage safe—at all times—at that season?</p>

<p>6. What weather—tide—current—sea, may be expected?</p>

<p>7. Examine windlass carefully—be certain you know how
to work same <b>at night</b>.</p>

<p>8. Look to compressors—capstans—and anchor davits,
if fitted.</p>

<p>9. Look to hand gear—that brake beams, bars, and
stoppers are handy, and where located.</p>

<p>10. Look for fo'c'sle hose, and connection. Be ready to
flush off a chain covered with mud, so there will be no delay
when heaving in.</p>

<p>11. Look for docking telegraph—learn dial.</p>

<p>12. Have Deck Engineer and Carpenter inspect the windlass
with you, get all the wrinkles you can about same.</p>

<p>13. Look for vessels near at hand. Is vessel clear of
them when tide turns?</p>

<p>14. Is vessel loading or discharging?</p>

<p>15. Are lighters expected—which side—what cargo?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
16. Are cork fenders and skids ready?</p>

<p>17. Are heaving lines handy?</p>

<p>18. Are lines ready for the lighters?</p>

<p>19. Look after gangway and side ladders.</p>

<p>20. Are cargo clusters in order—where kept?</p>

<p>21. Are riding lights in order?</p>

<p>22. Has anchor watch been set?</p>

<p>23. Is a working and life boat swung out and ready for
lowering without delay?</p>

<p>24. If blowing, have drift lead over side, tend same, and
watch bearings.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Vessel Alongside.</b> If the vessel is alongside the new
Chief Mate should note the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>1. Look after mooring lines.</p>

<p>2. Are they adjusted to the rise and fall of tide?</p>

<p>3. Are they free from chafe?</p>

<p>4. Are they properly disposed—springs, breasts, bow and
stern lines—this is an art. Can one watchman tend them?</p>

<p>5. Do they all bear an equal stress—this is important
with wire hawsers.</p>

<p>6. If near wooden warehouses—see if a wire fire warp
has been led.</p>

<p>7. Are the gangways safe?</p>

<p>8. If bow or stern projects beyond bulkhead line, are
lights ready?</p>

<p>9. If twin-screw vessel, are propeller signs in place?</p>

<p>10. Is a gangway watch necessary—is it being kept?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
11. Is the vessel discharging or loading—what—what
holds—how near completed?</p>

<p>12. What is the draft—forward and aft?</p>

<p>13. How much water under her at low tide?</p>

<p>14. Is the berth fair or foul?</p>

<p>15. Telephone connection on dock. Number of Police,
Fire, U. S. Secret Service.</p>

<p>16. Locate water plugs on docks.</p>

<p>17. Are rat guards on lines? Are they needed?</p>

</div>

<p><b>In General.</b> 1. Ask for cargo diagrams—how kept—if
loading.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>2. Are the working holds under supervision—by whom?</p>

<p>3. When will vessel be discharged—or ready to leave?</p>

<p>4. Get reports from the junior officers—the boatswain
and carpenter.</p>

<p>5. Will she work at night?</p>

<p>6. Are cargo clusters ready—length of cables—location
of connections—are they in good order—where kept?</p>

<p>7. Are the fire lines clear and in working order?</p>

<p>8. When was last fire drill held—inspect log?</p>

<p>9. Inspect crew list—muster same.</p>

<p>10. Inspect station bill.</p>

<p>11. Inspect crew's quarters. Look for signs of intoxicating
liquors—destroy any found.</p>

<p>12. Are bills of lading in order?</p>

<p>13. Look after cargo gear—stays—masts—booms—guys—pendants—falls—whips—gins—skids—cargo slings—cargo
falls—cargo hooks—nets, winches—etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
14. Are hatch covers, strong backs, battens, tarpaulins,
wedges, etc., ready and in good order?</p>

<p>15. Pay special attention to the flanges on the steel strongbacks—are
they true?</p>

<p>16. Get acquainted with the engineers and establish
friendly relations—this is important.</p>

<p>17. Locate all sounding pipes—Have carpenter sound
tanks and bilges and report.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="center">THE WORK OF THE CHIEF MATE</h3>

<p>Having reported for duty, and having seen to the matters
outlined above—and a smart Chief Mate sees such things
quickly, for he must by that time have spent more than a
dog watch in the Merchant Service—the new Chief Mate can
intelligently carry on the work of his vessel.</p>

<p><b>Different Vessels.</b> Differences in construction, type,
tonnage, and trade, modify the size and kind of organization
on board a steamer. But in the main essentials, the work of
the Chief Mate should be fairly standard—he is charged
with the supervision of everything that has to do with the
work of the deck department.</p>

<p><b>Crew.</b> The Chief Mate should study his junior officers
and his crew. He should at once check up the crew list;
see that the living quarters on board—including coal passers,
firemen, and glory hole—are in a sanitary and ship shape
condition. He should see after everything having to do
with the sanitary condition of the vessel. Wash rooms,
water closets, showers, lockers, mess rooms, etc. All should
be inspected daily.</p>

<p><b>Station Bill.</b> The Chief Mate should see that the Station
Bill is properly made out, and posted as required by law.</p>

<p><b>Inventories.</b> The materials and tools of the deck department
come under the immediate charge of the Chief Mate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
who should see that all inventories are correctly kept, and
that the stores list is properly posted up from time to time.
The correct list of unbroken ship's stores is very important,
and must be produced when the vessel enters the customs.</p>

<p>The following lists should be kept and checked under the
supervision of the Chief Mate:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>A. Mooring lines, and hawsers—wire—manila—hemp.</p>

<p>B. Tarpaulins—awnings—sails—dodgers—side screens—wind
sails—ventilator covers—skylight covers—spare boat covers—mast
covers, etc.,</p>

<p>C. Boatswain's stores, rope, gear, tools, etc.</p>

<p>D. Carpenter's stores, tools, lamps, oils, etc.</p>

<p>E. Paints—oils—turpentine—white lead—red lead—bitumastic—bottom
composition—putty, brushes, graining tools, etc., etc.</p>

<p>F. Cargo gear—in use, condition, location, etc. Spare gear—condition
and where stowed.</p>

<p>G. Ship's navigating gear (under care of Second Mate).</p>

<p>H. Coaling gear, condition, where stowed.</p>

<p>I. Life-saving equipment—boats, rafts and their complete equipment.
When bread boxes were last filled—inspected, when breakers were last
filled, etc. Life preservers—number—location—last inspected. Fire
hose, when supplied length, and location of reels, nozzles, couplings,
reducers, valves, etc. Fire extinguishers, kind—number—location—when
charged last. Axes, number—location. Buckets—number—location. Smoke
helmets, condition and where stowed. Extra tarpaulins.</p>

<p>Also ring buoys, rockets, line-throwing gun, spare lines, projectiles,
powder charges—sewed in bunting bags, and stowed in proper canister.
Coston lights, number—kind. Wave oil, tanks and fittings.</p>

<p>J. Ship's signal gear—flags—rockets—etc. (under charge of Third
Mate).</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></div>

<h3 class="center">DUTIES IN PORT</h3>

<p>Having familiarized himself with his vessel, her complement,
equipment, and stores, the Chief Mate is ready
to take up his duties with full knowledge of the situation.</p>

<p>The inspection of the vessel, from stem to stern, is a
matter of some time and, in a large steamer, calls for repeated
investigation. Every hole and tank and corner should be
known to the Chief Mate, its condition, its contents, and
its use.</p>

<p><b>Deck Crew.</b> He must organize and supervise the routine
work of the deck department of the vessel.</p>

<p>Third Mate—forward holds, under immediate eye of Chief Mate.</p>

<p>Second Mate—after holds.</p>

<p>Boatswain, in active charge of crew at work on deck,
over the side, and in holds.</p>

<p>Carpenter, at work about ship, under orders from the
Chief Mate.</p>

<p>Quartermasters—gangway, bridge, and hold watches,
under junior officers.</p>

<p>In large steamers where extra watch officers, junior
officers and cadets, or sub-junior officers are carried, the Chief
Mate usually has a clerk, and his work is largely that of a
general manager. In such vessels the cargo, mail, baggage,
specie, etc., is handled through the purser, or other officer,
and the Chief Mate devotes himself strictly to the management
of the seamanship end of his department.</p>

<p><b>Holds.</b> He must supervise the preparation of holds to
receive cargo.</p>

<p>'Tween deck and hold electrical connections—in good order.</p>

<p>Lift tank covers.</p>

<p>Take-up tank manholes (engineers).</p>

<p>Examine cement in tanks.</p>

<p>See that stanchion brackets and shifting boards are ready for
bulk cargoes, such as grain.</p>

<p>See that sufficient dunnage is in each hold; spruce planking, and
chocking pieces. Find out what kind of cargo is to be stowed.</p>

<p>See all hold ladders in good order—rungs all secure.</p>

<p>Look for runs of rust, under frames and stringers, in wake of mast
doublings, under winch beds, under deck in wake of shrouds.</p>

<p>Examine all ports and dead lights in 'tween decks.</p>

<p>Examine all side ports—cargo—coal.</p>

<p>All rust should be cleaned off and painted—red lead and pigment
in linseed oil.</p>

<p>See all bulkhead doors tight and in working order.</p>

<p>Spare propeller blades, booms, anchors, hubs, etc., stowed below,
should be examined as to lashings and rust. Spare shafting usually
carried in shaft tunnel, under charge of Chief Engineer, if in hold,
Chief Mates responsible for safety.</p>

<p>Look to all wire lashings <i>in the nips</i>.</p>

<p>Look for leaks in joints of shell plating abreast of hatches where
drafts of cargo swing in against the side.</p>

<p>Examine masts, at doublings, at the steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
Examine all fire lines and connections in holds and 'tween decks.</p>

<p>Examine rivets under bed plates of winches.</p>

<p>Examine framing under hatch coamings.</p>

<p>Examine state of pillars and stanchions.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Cargo Gear.</b> The Chief Mate is charged with the proper
use and upkeep of the cargo handling gear. This includes
everything except the steam winches, and steam lines which
are under the charge of the engineer department.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate should supervise and attend to the
following—note condition and provide for proper maintenance:</p>

<div class="indent bold">

<p>Masts—and all fittings, viz.—collars—trucks—sheaves—links—
shrouds—stays—and all equipment on masts, whether cargo, radio,
lights, or lookout cages.</p>

<p>King posts—same as masts—re-cargo handling.</p>

<p>Booms—goosenecks—bands—links—shackles—sheaves—gins—guys—and
cradles.</p>

<p>Examine all shrouds and stays under the nips and thimbles.</p>

<p>Examine all links—turnbuckles—bales—eye bolts—pins—cleats—etc.,
for excessive wear, or fracture.</p>

<p>If wind platforms are fitted see to all stanchions, struts and
brasses.</p>

<p>When heavy purchases are to be rove, the Chief Mate should
carefully supervise the preparation of the gear—preventers—lashings—etc.</p>

<p>See that winches are powerful enough to take the load safely.</p>

<p>See that booms are strong enough or are fished and reinforced
where needed.</p>

<p>Shore up weak goosenecks.</p>

<p>Rig preventer guys—stays—etc.</p>

</div>

<p>Leave nothing to chance—use new gear—know the weight to be
lifted—be sure it will clear the hatch coamings—the bulwarks—take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
your time. It takes ten times as long to clear away a wreck as to
make the most careful preparation for lifting a heavy weight.</p>

<p>Learn the way to run the winches, their construction—lifting
capacity—steam pressure on lines—how to drain after working in
cold weather, locate pet cocks—know when they are properly lubricated.
Know as much as you can about steam and electrical deck
machinery—(don't let your curiosity stop here—find out all you can
about the main engines and boilers, it is interesting).</p>

<p>See that cargo falls come to the winch drums without chafing at
the heels of booms, or other places.</p>

<p>Winchmen and hatch tenders are often found working their
hatches with booms at the wrong angle—be ready to correct this.
See that booms are properly plumbed when lifting heavy strongbacks
from the guides, or when attempting to ship them. If in a
roadstead, vessel feeling the swell, have guys and bull-ropes rove to
steady strongbacks or other heavy weights lifted over the hatches.</p>

<p>Examine all pins of gin blocks, see that they are properly lubricated
with plumbago.</p>

<p>When beginning to work cargo, either in or out, see that all
slings, nets, falls, are in good order and that sufficient have been
supplied. Look after chain slings carefully in person, this saves
accidents—look at the hooks, see that jaws have not been opened, if
so, discard.</p>

<p>Look after hatch boards and skids.</p>

<p><b>Working Cargo.</b> When the vessel is working cargo,
whether with crew or stevedores, the Chief Mate is in
responsible charge. He is responsible for the good condition
of the gear, the proper stowage of the cargo, and the
lawful handling, stowage, and carriage of combustibles. He
should inform himself on this point.</p>

<p><b>Whistle Signals.</b> It is well, when working cargo, in cases
where the Chief Mate takes active direction of operations,
such as taking in or discharging extra heavy weights, to
use a whistle signal when communicating with the winch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
and hatch men. Excessive singing out and undue noise of
any kind indicates raw work and lack of real seamanship.</p>

<p><b>Engages Stevedores.</b> In many trades the Chief Mate
engages the Stevedores and keeps a record of their time.</p>

<p><b>Care of Cargo.</b> At the close of the working day the Chief
Mate should see that the hatches are properly covered, the
tarpaulins laid smooth and in proper number, and securely
wedged, with battens, if necessary.</p>

<p>During the day, or at any time while the hatches are
open while working cargo, or otherwise, if rain is impending,
the Chief Mate should use his judgment about covering
hatches in which perishable cargo is exposed. He should
also keep an eye on lighters alongside, and see that the
lightermen cover their cargoes in plenty of time.</p>

<p>Scuppers, outboard discharge pipes, as from the circulating
pump, should be considered when lighters carrying
perishable cargo are alongside.</p>

<p>It is difficult often to establish the truth in regard to
claims for damaged cargo, and blame often attaches to the
ship, with resulting loss to the owners. This is often the
case abroad—lightermen and consignees are often of the
same nationality—great care in safeguarding the interests
of the owners and the shippers is necessary.</p>

<p><b>Duty to Cargo.</b> The Chief Mate who establishes a record
for the care of cargo stamps himself as a man of reliable
qualities—one who is bound to gain the confidence of his
superiors and owners.</p>

<p>Too much attention cannot be paid to this important
part of the duty of a sea officer in the Merchant Service.
The duty to cargo is a trust that should be impressed upon
the minds of all members of the crew.</p>

<p>Many officers, in charge of cargo work, look upon this
part of their duty as a necessary nuisance—something to
be bothered with as little as possible. On the other hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
an alert officer can prevent damage, and consequent loss to
owners, amounting to more than his salary on every voyage.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate should so regulate the hold duty, that
the junior officers can relieve each other, and get the maximum
amount of liberty. In ships so conducted, officers do
not mind attending to business while on duty. Where hold
duty is conducted on the chain gang system—all work and
no leave—the owners suffer; so does the reputation of the
Chief Mate.</p>

<p><b>Pilfering of Cargo.</b> In many trades pilfering from the
cargo has become a science. Wine casks are sprung out of
true and the contents made away with, hoops are knocked
loose and holes are drilled. In ports where the junk boat
nuisance still prevails, vessels working cargo of all kinds are
the victims of wholesale thievery. This sort of thing can
only be stopped by vigilant supervision on the part of the
officers of the vessel. Only reliable men should be put in
the holds as watchmen. Offenders who are caught should
be prosecuted—not merely discharged. The broaching of
cargo by the crew is a serious offense.</p>

<p>The loss must be made good, and the offender may be
sentenced to a year in jail.</p>

<p><b>Accidents; Damage to Cargo.</b> Accidents resulting in
loss of cargo, or damage to same due to the fault of the
vessel's tackle, due to rain, washing of the ship's decks, discharge
through leaking scuppers, are blamable to the Chief
Mate and through him to the Master and owners of the
vessel.</p>

<p><b>Stowage of Cargo.</b> When stowing or discharging cargo
the Chief Mate should keep in mind the trim and stability
of the vessel. When any question as to her seaworthy condition
arises, he should report the fact to the Master without
delay.</p>

<p><b>Freeboard.</b> The freeboard in American steamers is fixed
by rules of the underwriters. The load line should not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
be submerged (except in fresh water, when the vessel is to
go out in salt water. The Chief Mate should know the rule
governing loading for a salt water voyage in a fresh water
port).</p>

<p><b>Cargo Diagrams.</b> In taking aboard cargo to be delivered
at a number of different ports, the hold diagrams
are very important. Such diagrams of cargo stowage
should be prepared by the officer in charge of the holds and
submitted to the Chief Mate for approval.</p>

<p><b>Invoices; Bills of Lading.</b> The Chief Mate receipts for all
consignments of cargo, when same is delivered on board in ports abroad,
or where no provision is made for handling such details by the freight
department of the company. In the tramp this duty is almost always
placed upon the Chief Mate. He is responsible for the accuracy of his
receipts, and that cargo signed for is in good condition and as
represented—marks—numbers—etc., before allowing same to be stowed.</p>

<p>Cargoes are usually accepted or rejected by the Mate on
his own responsibility.</p>

<p><small>(A case in point where sugar, in bags, was brought alongside on
a lighter, all nicely stacked. Best bags on top tier. This sugar
had been wet with salt water—and was rejected on inspection by
"tasting" the bags of the second tier.)</small></p>

<p><b>Ventilation of Cargo.</b> The Master is held responsible for
the proper ventilation of cargo. This responsibility is of
course delegated to the Chief Mate who personally is accountable
to the Master for the careful carrying out of this requirement.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Cargo.</b> Cargoes are generally classified as
"Measurement" and "Dead Weight" cargoes. Most cargoes
are "General" or mixed. Then of course there are
fluid cargoes, carried in bulk in tankers. The Chief Mate
who knows his business, will have mastered the various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
"kinks" that go with the stowage and discharging of many
kinds of cargo.</p>

<p>It is only possible here to indicate, in a brief fashion,
the things the Chief Mate should look after and know about.</p>

<p><b>Coal Cargo.</b> The Chief Mate should see that stowage
is not commenced until the hold has been properly
prepared. See that steel masts are carefully sealed, at the
heel, that there is no "up take" for gases, in the event of
fire. See that every possible point of "up take" is stopped
off. See that shifting boards are firmly secured. That
pillars and stanchions are secure, if they have been replaced,
and that the hold, if length of passage warrants, is fitted
with a gas pipe, plugged at bottom end, for lowering a
thermometer into the body of the cargo. Temperatures
should be taken at least every watch.</p>

<p><b>Ventilation.</b> Ventilation, <b>on the surface of the coal</b>, is
very necessary. Two ventilators, at least, for each hold;
an intake and an uptake (uptake to windward).</p>

<p><b>Wet Coal.</b> Wet coal is dangerous—it is specially subject
to spontaneous combustion.</p>

<p><b>Trimming.</b> In loading coal cargo, where nothing else is
taken, the trim of the vessel should be carefully watched by
the Chief Mate, and the trimmers directed in their work so
that no subsequent trimming is required after the cargo is
all on board. Many kinds of coal sift down and flow easily—this
should be kept in mind.</p>

<p><b>Ore Cargo.</b> Vessels carrying ore are usually designed for
that particular trade. Where ore is to be carried in the
usual type of freighter, special care must be taken to fit the
required trunks and shifting boards. Heavy ore carried in
the lower holds is liable to make a vessel crank, and the
Chief Mate should see that means are provided for the
lifting up of the weights, and the proper distribution, fore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
and aft. The usual plan, in a vessel with four holds, is to
fill No. 2 and No. 3, and trim with No. 1 and No. 4. This
keeps the cargo high amidships, and eases the vessel in a
seaway.</p>

<p><b>Wooden Steamers.</b> The shipment of ore cargoes in
vessels of weak construction, should not be attempted unless
the movement of the ore cannot be accomplished in any
other way. The wooden steamers, built as an emergency
measure, are a case in point.</p>

<p>The highest skill in loading, stowage and handling will
be required for these vessels.</p>

<p><b>Grain Cargo.</b> The carriage of grain cargo calls for special
precautions to prevent shifting. The British Board of Trade
and the underwriters have made special rules for the stowage
of such cargoes. The Chief Mate should inform himself of
these rules as a part of his stock of knowledge.</p>

<p><b>Cotton Cargo.</b> The danger to fire when loading a cotton
cargo is great and every precaution should be taken. Smoking,
which should never be permitted in the holds or about
the hatches at any time, should be specially guarded against
when loading cotton.</p>

<p>Care should be taken that no sparks from the funnels,
from passing or nearby tugboats, or from steam boilers on
the wharf, find their way into the hatches. Have the fire
lines connected up at all times and have the steam on the
smothering lines.</p>

<p>Steam is the best agent for smothering a cotton fire.
If a fire starts do not wet down the decks or side plating.
This may get very hot, but do not play cold water on it.
Strains would be set up in the plating or deck that might
seriously injure it.</p>

<p>Keep all oil cans, oily waste, paint, paint pots or paint
rags and brushes away from the cotton.</p>

<p>Keep all ventilator cowls closed, to prevent sparks finding
their way into the cargo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
When hatches are closed down at night, or when battening
down for sea, the Chief Mate should have an officer
make certain that no fire is present in the holds.</p>

<p>All electrical conduits through the holds and 'tween
decks should be carefully inspected before loading a cotton
cargo.</p>

<p><b>Smoke Helmets.</b> The smoke helmets should be handy
and in order.</p>

<p><b>Frozen Cargo.</b> Vessels carrying frozen cargo are lined
and insulated in the holds prepared for this sort of stowage.
All steel work should be covered, on account of the high
conductivity of the metal. The insulating materials are
usually granulated cork, charcoal, silicate cotton, or sawdust.
Felt and cow hair is also used. Dead air, if properly
confined, is an excellent insulating medium.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to avoid and detect fire in the
insulating material, due to spontaneous combustion.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate should be familiar with the system of refrigeration
used—cold-air—dry-air—ammonia—carbonic-anhydride—etc.</p>

<p>In some systems the air is chilled in the holds by piping,
in others the air is drawn from the holds to a chilling chamber
and pumped back with the required degree of cold.</p>

<p><b>Chilled Beef.</b> Chilled beef is usually shipped in quarters,
and must be suspended from the deck above by chains and
hooks.</p>

<p><b>Frozen Mutton.</b> Mutton is usually shipped in carcases,
frozen stiff and stowed one on top of another. Being hollow,
the interstices provide space for the circulation of cold air.
About 15 degrees Fahrenheit should be maintained in the
hold.</p>

<p><b>General Cargo.</b> Every general cargo is a rule unto itself.
The Chief Mate who knows his business will see to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
proper stowage. This is the cargo that demands care as
to hold diagrams. The following points are recommended
for consideration:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>Keep perishable goods clear of the steel framing.</p>

<p>Cargo liable to leakage should be stowed low.</p>

<p>Cargo liable to damage from heat should be kept clear of engine-room
bulkheads, steam lines, and not stowed close under upper deck when in
hot weather trades.</p>

<p>Casks, bung up and bilge free. Stow from amidships to wings and ends of
hold. Use four beds for each cask.</p>

<p>Casks, second tier—stow bilge and cutline.</p>

<p>Barrels, hogsheads, etc. (63 gals.) eight heights.</p>

<p>Puncheons (84 gals.) four heights.</p>

<p>Pipes, butts, (126 gals.) three tiers.</p>

<p>Always stow barrels, wet or dry, with head pieces vertical.</p>

<p>Stow with marks up and out.</p>

<p>Acids, on deck.</p>

<p>Oilskins, on deck.</p>

<p>Matches, on deck.</p>

<p>Hay, on deck.</p>

<p>Heavy, well-boxed cargo, low.</p>

<p>Light crates, on top.</p>

<p>Railroad iron, grating fashion.</p>

<p>Dunnage, if needed, 10 inches on floors, 15 inches in bilges.</p>

<p>Cargo ports, if fitted, blocked off with dunnage.</p>

</div>

<p>Care should be taken to stow liquors, canned goods, and things easily
broken open, in parts of the hold and 'tween decks where they can be
easily blocked off by less tempting cargo.</p>

<p><b>Special Cargoes.</b> Cargoes of chemicals, fruit, guano, jute,
and the like, will require special care and consideration. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
deck officers of a merchant vessel will do well if they keep
and compare notes on matters such as these. A vast amount
of information having to do with the important function of
moving the products of the world is going begging for the
want of suitable recording. Such knowledge carries with it
the possibility for great saving. Merchant mariners, owners,
and naval designers take notice. The cargo note book is
an important part of the baggage of an officer.</p>

<p><b>Munitions.</b> Cargoes under the general heading of munitions
call for the most careful handling. It is well for the
Chief Mate to know just what is being stowed, and where.
This knowledge should be of use in exercising increased care
in the management and handling of the vessel. The Halifax
disaster is a case in point.</p>

<p><b>Cost Data.</b> The Chief Mate who is on his job should
keep cost data on stevedoring, and in fact on most operations
performed on board ship. He should know how many men
can work a hatch effectively, and what their pay is, and how
much cargo they can stow, say in tons (2,000 lbs.) per
working day:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>Cost data resolves itself into this.</p>

<p>Amount of work done—any unit; tons of cargo—sq. ft. of paint.</p>

<p>Number of men—and pay:</p>

</div>

<div class="indent2">

<p>Hatchmen at $.00 per hour.</p>

<p>Holdmen at $.00 per hour.</p>

<p>Lightermen or truckers at $.00 per hour.</p>

<p>Checkers—tally men at $.00 per hour.</p>

</div>

<div class="indent">

<p>Time required to do the work.</p>

<p>Kind of cargo stowed.</p>

<p>Port.</p>

<p>Remarks—weather—sea—etc.</p>

</div>

<p>Cost data, actually kept, often is the foundation for
important work later on as superintendent and manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
Keeping cost data is a good way to relieve the monotony
of supervising stevedores—it results in a note book of considerable
value.</p>

<p><b>Live Stock.</b> Vessels carrying live stock present added
problems for the consideration of the Chief Mate. He should
see to the proper organization of the cattlemen, their attention
to duty, etc. The Chief Mate should be familiar with
the laws relating to the carriage of live stock on passenger
vessels.</p>

<p>Horse slings should be provided for valuable animals.
Other cattle taken aboard in the stream are often slung
on board by the horns alone.</p>

<p>Valuable horses should be placed in padded boxes, placed
athwartships, and same fitted with slings under the bellies
of the animals.</p>

<p><b>Passengers.</b> Passengers are usually the special care of
the Purser and Steward. The Chief Mate, however, should
so organize the work of the ship that there is as little interference
with the passengers as possible. The Second Mate,
is usually delegated as baggage officer and has charge of the
stowage and breaking out of this special cargo.</p>

<p><b>Tank Steamers.</b> Tank steamers, like everything else,
are undergoing changes in design, and each vessel requires
special study on the part of the officers.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate should be familiar with the system of
piping and the handling of the same. He should study the
pipe diagrams and trace out the lead and use of everything
for his own information.</p>

<p>There are many things in tank steamers not common to
the regular run of sea carriers. The hose connections, the
method of trimming, the use of summer tanks, the expansion
trunks, and the many wrinkles having to do with the
care and management of tankers.</p>

<p>When going into dry dock, be sure and see that all tanks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
are "gas free" before lights or red hot rivets are introduced.
This is done by steaming them out, by blowing air through
them, and by filling with water and pumping same out, the
oil in the water, which should be overflowing, will run off
first.</p>

<p>The officer who is going into tank steamers, or is in that
service is advised to get a small pamphlet by Mr. Herbert
John White, a British Merchant Marine officer, called OIL
TANK STEAMERS, published by James Brown and Son,
Glasgow, and for sale in New York by D. Van Nostrand
Company (price $1.00). This is a very clear and practical
manual for the use of tank steamer officers—one of the best
books of its kind.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
THE CHIEF MATE (Continued)</h2>

<p><b>Receiving Stores.</b> All stores delivered to the vessel
should be received by the officer of the deck. The Chief
Mate should provide for the proper receipt and the proper
entries either in a log book or in a stores receipt book. Everything
should be checked, weighed, and measured. This
should be the basis for the approval of bills from supply
houses, etc.</p>

<p><b>Keys.</b> The key board of a vessel should be the direct
charge of the Chief Mate, delegated, if necessary, but he
should see that the keys are kept in order, properly marked,
and only in the possession of those entitled to have them in
charge. Receipts should be given for all keys drawn from
the key board.</p>

<p><b>Master Keys.</b> The master keys should be in the possession
of the Chief Mate, and of the Master. When the
Chief Mate goes ashore, the master keys should be left
with the officer in charge of the ship during his absence.</p>

<p>The key board is a fair indication of the efficiency of
a vessel.</p>

<p><b>Harbor Regulations.</b> All harbor regulations should be
observed. It is the duty of the Chief Mate to acquaint
himself with these rules and see that the vessel and the
crew abide by them.</p>

<p><b>Turning To.</b> The time when men turn to and knock off,
while in harbor, should be regulated by the Chief Mate,
subject to companies' rules, customs, etc. It is well to abide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
strictly to these rules, but when the safety of the vessel, or
the necessities of work require it, extra work may be demanded
by the Chief Mate.</p>

<p>In the point of work in port, and at sea, for that matter,
working conditions are now bound up in agreements between
companies and seamen's unions. Much of this is necessary
and was brought about by abuses practiced upon seamen in
days past.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate who gives his crew a right deal, and knows
how to handle and take care of his men, never has any trouble
in getting work done after hours. The answer is be human—also
just and firm—no sailor has any use for a jelly fish officer.</p>

<p><b>Upkeep.</b> The work in port is usually confined to washing
down, cleaning up after the stevedores, preparing holds
for cargo, painting over the side, painting the boot-topping
when the vessel is light, and cleaning up after coaling. At
this time the steering gear and steering engine should be
looked after, cleaned up and overhauled.</p>

<p>Wooden decks should be washed down every morning,
as at sea, especially if in a warm port.</p>

<p>Cover the ends of mooring lines, to keep out dirt and
grit; stow superfluous lines below—but handy—this keeps
them away from harm, <b>and the junk boats</b>.</p>

<p>Unscrew and stow away all brass fittings—when in ports
where these things can be disposed of—in most ports where
the vessel lies at an unwatched wharf.</p>

<p>All persons leaving the vessel with packages, and suit
cases—unless officers or officials—should show contents to
the gangway watch.</p>

<p>No one should be allowed on the bridge or bridge deck,
unless there on business.</p>

<p><b>Fire Hoses, Axes, Buckets, Extinguishers, etc.</b> The
Chief Mate is charged with the care and working order of
the fire-fighting equipment of the vessel.</p>

<p>Fire drills must be held as required by law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
<b>Life-saving Equipment.</b> The Chief Mate must pay
special attention to the condition and readiness of the life
boats, and their equipment:</p>

<div class="misc">

<ol class="n">
 <li>Life boats.</li>
 <li>Life rafts.</li>
 <li>Life belts.</li>
 <li>Ring buoys.</li>
 <li>Water lights.</li>
 <li>Storm-oil tanks.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>He should see that the bread tins, after each inspection,
are tightly screwed down, or the contents may spoil, or be
unfit at the next inspection by the U. S. Steamboat Inspectors.</p>

<p>The list of required boat equipment is a long one and
should be carefully complied with.</p>

<p>The rockets and line-throwing gun should be kept in
good order, lines and projectiles handy; charges measured
out and sewed in proper bags and kept in a copper canister.</p>

<p>The boat-launching equipment must be kept in perfect
working condition, davits, strongbacks, gripes and falls.
The required tubs must be provided and the boat falls
coiled in them, clear for running.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate must organize and carry out the required
drills.</p>

<p>After all drills—see everything secured—hoses dried out,
extinguishers recharged—if used, axes, life belts, ring buoys,
life preservers, etc. stowed.</p>

<p><b>Ground Tackle.</b> The Chief Mate is charged with the
good order and upkeep of the ground tackle.</p>

<p>He should look after:</p>

<div class="misc">

<ol class="n">
 <li>Anchors.</li>
 <li>Chain.</li>
 <li>Riding chocks.</li>
 <li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
     Shackles.</li>
 <li>Pins.</li>
 <li>Forelocks.</li>
 <li>Markings (by turns of wire on studs), paint shackles white, as an aid
     in noting run of chain at night.</li>
 <li>Chain compressors.</li>
 <li>Stoppers.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<div class="indent">

<p>Chain should be ranged when in dry dock, if time permits, and
locker cleaned out and painted. See that ends of the chains are
lashed at the <i>top</i> of the chain locker.</p>

<p>The kedges and stream anchors should be where they can be got
at. See that the necessary gear for getting them out is ready and
stowed handy for use.</p>

<p>The windlass is in charge of the engineers. The Chief Mate
should understand its working, and the Carpenter should also understand
it in every detail.</p>

<p>See that the hand gear is in order and can be worked by the
crew. It is a good plan to try this out when opportunity offers.
When the emergency comes there is little time to drill.</p>

</div>

<p><b>When Coming to Anchor, or Heaving In.</b> The Chief
Mate takes his station on the f'c'sle head. He is in charge
of the ground tackle.</p>

<p class="bold">Anchoring.</p>

<p>Report when anchors are ready to let go.</p>

<p>When anchor has been let go, report chain out as the shackles come
through the hawse. When the anchor is down, report chain out. Trend of
chain, etc.</p>

<p class="bold">Heaving in.</p>

<div class="misc">

<ol class="n">
  <li>Report "Short Stay."</li>
  <li>Report the shackles as they come to the water.</li>
  <li>Report "Anchor aweigh."</li>
  <li>Report "Anchor in sight"—"clear," or "foul anchor."</li>
  <li>Report anchor secured.</li>
  <li>Report both anchors ready for letting go.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
A smart Chief Mate manages his work on the f'c'sle
head without any unnecessary singing out. In large ships
the telegraph or whistle, or hand signals are used between
the Master on the bridge and the Chief Mate.</p>

<p>The "trend" of the chain, when heaving in, should be
indicated to the bridge by direction of the hand. If heaving
in in a tide way, this information is important, and the engines
are used to assist in breaking out, while the vessel is given
a proper sheer with the helm.</p>

<p><b>Coming Alongside.</b> As in coming to anchor, the Chief
Mate's station is on the forecastle head. He directs the
handling of the vessel's forward lines, the operation of the
capstans, etc.</p>

<p>The Carpenter, Boatswain, and about half of the deck
crew should be assigned to this end of the vessel.</p>

<p>See all side ports closed or clear above string piece:
Boats swung in if necessary, etc.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate carries out lines, and handles the warps
and springs as directed by the Master, from the bridge. As
little calling out of orders as possible should be indulged in.
Where both Mate and Master understand their business, the
coming alongside is a mere matter of detail and works without
a hitch. Where tugs are used, the Chief Mate should
direct the taking of lines, but the tugs receive their instructions
direct from the bridge.</p>

<p>Study of tide, wind, and local conditions, as well as
knowledge of the vessel herself, aid in smoothness in the
performance of this evolution.</p>

<p>Have handy, heaving lines, cork fenders, and if necessary
have a running boat and crew ready to carry out the lines
to the wharf. Send men on the wharf rather than trust to
help from casual loiterers.</p>

<p><b>When Alongside.</b> When alongside, see proper spring
lines led so that vessel can be shifted fore and aft as may be
necessary in the working of the cargo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
The proper mooring of the vessel is in charge of the Chief
Mate. He should satisfy himself that she is safe, that the
lines are disposed in the best possible way, free from chafe, and
that the vessel will lie without binding when at high water.</p>

<p><b>Rat Guards.</b> Where necessary, see that rat guards are
placed on all lines without delay.</p>

<p>In making fast, the Chief Mate should inform himself
of the best position of the ship for unloading or loading.
The location of the doors, if the wharf is covered, with
respect to the hatches. The location of chutes, water
plugs, etc.</p>

<p>If lighters are to come in between the vessel and the
wharf, means should be at hand for breasting off, and for
providing a gangway during this operation.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate must plan ahead, think of what is
needed, and provide for it. He must keep such problems
to himself and not bother the Master.</p>

<p>Overhang of the vessel's bow or stern at the off-shore
end of a wharf or pier should be considered; lights provided,
fenders handy, and extra breasts, and bow or stern lines led
for safety.</p>

<p><b>Coaling.</b> The operation of coaling differs greatly in
different ports and in different vessels. The handling of
the vessel and the rigging and care of the coaling gear is
a part of the duty of the deck department and is under the
supervision of the Chief Mate. In ports where gangways
are led to the wharf, or stages swung over side and the coal
passed up in baskets, or carried up by the shore gang, the
problem is simple.</p>

<p>In ports like Coronel, Chile, where vessels lie in the
stream and hoist the coal up in canvas slings, considerable
care should be given to the gear and the leads to the deck
winches.</p>

<p>Coaling ship is a partnership affair, and harmonious
working between the deck and engineers is essential.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
Where the vessel lies under chutes, the trimming and
supervision of same is up to the black squad, and a great
deal of trouble is saved if this is done carefully. Where
necessary see that spars or camels are ranged alongside to
give the vessel the required distance from the chutes—this
applies to small steamers with comparatively narrow beam.</p>

<p>Watch the mooring lines when coaling under the chutes—take
in the slack as necessary.</p>

<p><b>Entering Dry Dock.</b> When a vessel is about to enter a
dry dock the heads of the various departments should be
notified in time, and should be informed of the probable
length of stay in the dock.</p>

<p>Also notify U. S. Local Inspectors that vessel will go in
dock and bottom can be examined.</p>

<p>All refuse should be put ashore, and provision made for
taking care of any that may accumulate while on the dock.</p>

<p>See that necessary lines, fenders, ladders, etc., are handy.</p>

<p>Prepare to do the work that is necessary on board ship,
and best done while the vessel is dry, viz.,</p>

<div class="misc">

<ol class="n">
 <li>Paint scuppers; hose reels.</li>
 <li>Range cables on floor of dock, overhaul same.</li>
 <li>Clean and paint or bitumastic the chain lockers.</li>
 <li>Have windlass overhauled.</li>
 <li>Paint funnels; cargo booms, king posts, etc.</li>
 <li>Paint and overhaul boats.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>As the crew of a merchantman is not any too large,
only work that can be thoroughly done while in dock
should be attempted.</p>

<p><b>Blue Prints.</b> The blue prints of the docking plan should
be delivered to the dock master. All assistance should be
rendered to the dock master, and his instructions carefully
complied with.</p>

<p>If entering a graving dock, men will be needed to handle
the wale shores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
If entering a floating dock the vessel will rest squarely
upon her bottom.</p>

<p>Straight stemmed vessels can best be placed on an absolutely
level keel by swinging a hand lead over the stem; the
Chief Mate should see to this.</p>

<p>All closets, drains, and drip pipes should be shut off.</p>

<p>When the dock is dry the Chief Mate should make a
careful inspection of the bottom. If it is intended to drain
the tanks; double bottoms, peaks, etc., the carpenter should
remove the necessary plugs. As soon as the draining is
completed these should be replaced and the Chief Mate
should see that they have been replaced properly by personal
inspection. He should see that the plugs are not
wooden plugs—this has been done.</p>

<p>While the vessel is in dry dock, aside from any extraordinary
repairs that may be made, the following matters should
be looked after:</p>

<div class="misc">

<ol class="n">
 <li>Bottom cleaned and examined.</li>
 <li>Note fouling and state of previous coatings, and when last applied.</li>
 <li>Note corrosion and damage.</li>
 <li>Outboard valves should be examined and reground when necessary.</li>
 <li>Rudder pintles and gudgeons should be carefully examined. Rudder
 lifted, and repairs made if necessary.</li>
 <li>Stuffing boxes and valves of the rudder should be repacked.</li>
 <li>Look for corrosion along the butts of shell plating. Look for corroded
 rivets; such rivets should be removed and new ones driven.</li>
 <li>Look after all zincs at the stern frames, valve openings, and at the
 propellers.</li>
 <li>Examine struts, propeller shafting, brackets, etc.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p><b>Painting.</b> It is essential that the bottom be dry before
applying the anti-fouling paints. It should also be clean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
and the paint should be well stirred before being taken in the
individual buckets of the painters.</p>

<p>All metal but the zincs and the bronze propellers should
be covered.</p>

<p><b>Waterline.</b> The waterline should be properly struck;
nothing looks worse—except perhaps a camouflaged tramp—than
a vessel with a slovenly line to her boot top.</p>

<p>The correct and neat painting of the draft numerals on
stem and stern should be seen to.</p>

<p><b>Docking Notes.</b> It is well for the Chief Mate to keep
"docking notes," these will come in very handy later on.</p>

<p>Seeing a vessel out of water is vastly different from
merely inspecting her blue prints.</p>

<p><b>If Vessel Has Grounded.</b> If the vessel has grounded
before going on the dock, the greatest care should be taken
in her inspection.</p>

<p>The bottom should be "sighted"; the cement on the
tank bottoms and in the bilges should be examined for
cracks.</p>

<p>The dock master should be consulted before weights of
any kind are shifted while the vessel is on the blocks.</p>

<p><b>Duties of Chief Mate at Sea.</b> The duties of the Chief
Mate, while the vessel is at sea, depend upon the size and
organization of the ship. If a large vessel, he does not
stand a bridge watch, but devotes his entire time to the
management of the deck department of the vessel. He
is on duty all the time, but turns in at night, much the
same as the Master.</p>

<p>In most vessels the Chief Mate stands a watch, usually
the four to eight. This enables him to oversee things from
the bridge, which he should never leave, and it gives him
some time after breakfast to look over the vessel and outline
the work of the boatswain.</p>

<p>The duties of the watch, the navigation, and lookout,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
are much the same for all officers, and will be dealt with
under the chapter on the Officer of the Watch.</p>

<p>At sea the routine of keeping the vessel clean, of attending
to the upkeep of hull and gear, and of looking after the
ventilation of the cargo, is largely a matter of the particular
trade in which she is engaged.</p>

<p>A vessel jumping from port to port, with her booms up
and down twice a week, presents a different problem from
the vessel that keeps at sea a week or two at a time. The
weather, the kind of cargo, the fact that passengers are
carried or not, all tend to modify and direct the progress
of work on board.</p>

<p>Before the Panama Canal was built, cargo vessels trading
from the Atlantic Coast to the West Coast and the Hawaiian
Islands, carried out a routine at sea as comfortable and
settled as that of a sailing ship. Weather and time were in
their favor and the maximum amount of painting and overhauling
of gear could be attended to between ports.</p>

<p>So far as duty, aside from keeping watch is concerned,
the Chief Mate should look after the following:</p>

<div class="misc">

<ol class="n">

 <li>Have temperature of holds taken twice a day—coal cargo every watch.</li>
 <li>Arrange for inspection and ventilation as weather permits.</li>
 <li>Carry on all work with as little interference as possible, when
 passengers are on board.</li>
 <li>Take into consideration the weather, when about to start painting.
 Always clean all surfaces before applying paint.</li>
 <li>See a daily washdown of all wooden decks.</li>
 <li>Keep all canvas dodgers and screens scrupulously white.</li>
 <li>Under him the boatswain carries on the work as outlined.</li>
 <li>Boat drills, fire drill, etc., are carried out under his direction
 while at sea and duly entered in the log.</li>

</ol>

</div>

<p>The Chief Mate should see that all necessary assistance is given
to the officer of the watch—when he stands days duty—in matters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
of taking soundings, turning ventilators, setting and taking in
awnings, heaving the deep sea lead, etc. Where the Chief Mate
stands his watch, the watch officer on duty during a day watch is
technically in full charge, and gives his orders direct.</p>

<p><b>Cooperation.</b> The Chief Mate should manage his department
so that he will obtain the cooperation of the heads of
all other departments in the vessel, Chief Engineer, Purser,
Doctor, Chief Steward, all should be in harmony. A
thorough understanding of the work and needs of these
officers helps toward the smooth working of a ship.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion.</b> From the foregoing, it will be seen that the
Chief Mate who attends to his duty in every detail is a very
busy officer. It will also be noted that he is not called upon
to handle the hose while washing down (I have seen this
done), to juggle paint brushes, or sew a seam.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate must first of all be a sailor—he must
know how—his orders can only be successfully enforced when
backed up by the knowledge and experience that tell him
when things are going right or wrong.</p>

<p>The dignity and power of command come to the sea
officer who is fully competent and alive to the high responsibilities
of his calling. Much of his duty can be delegated—its
responsibility, however, always rests with him.</p>

<p>The Chief Mate who respects his billet, who respects
the work and the rights of those under him, and who makes
them respect the ship and himself, in turn, may well feel
satisfied. He has something concrete, something definite,
and worth while; he has his vessel to be proud of, and to
reflect credit upon himself and his service. Such an officer
is a gentlemen in the finest sense of the word—with all of
his duties, and they are many—he will find time to cultivate
ideals and expand his soul.</p>

<p>The prize of command will soon be his, and then he can
look forward to years of satisfying service as Master.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
RULES OF THE U. S. SUPERVISING INSPECTORS RELATING TO LIFESAVING</h2>

<h3 class="center">LIFE BOATS</h3>

<p>The capacity of lifeboats shall hereafter be determined by an
allowance of 15 cubic feet for each person carried.</p>

<h4>Equipment for lifeboats.</h4>

<p>All lifeboats on ocean steam vessels shall be equipped as
follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

 <p>A properly secured life line the entire length on each side, festooned
 in bights not longer than 3 feet, with a seine float in each bight.</p>

 <p>One painter of manila rope of not less than 2¾ inches in circumference
 and of suitable length.</p>

 <p>A full complement of oars and two spare oars.</p>

 <p>One set and a half of thole pins or rowlocks attached to the boat with
 separate chains.</p>

 <p>One steering oar with rowlock or becket and one rudder with tiller or
 yoke and yoke lines.</p>

 <p>One boat hook attached to a staff of suitable length.</p>

 <p>Two life preservers.</p>

 <p>Two hatchets.</p>

 <p>One galvanized-iron bucket with lanyard attached.</p>

 <p>One bailer.</p>

 <p>Where automatic plugs are not provided there shall be two plugs secured
 with chains for each drain hole.</p>

 <p>One efficient liquid compass with not less than a 2-inch card.</p>

 <p>One lantern containing sufficient oil to burn at least nine hours and
 ready for immediate use.</p>

 <p>One can containing one gallon of illuminating oil.</p>

 <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
 One box of friction-matches wrapped in a waterproof package and carried
 in a box secured to the underside of the stern thwart.</p>

 <p>A wooden breaker or suitable tank fitted with a siphon, pump, or spigot
 for drawing water, and containing at least 1 quart of water for each
 person.</p>

 <p>Two enameled drinking cups.</p>

 <p>A water-tight receptacle containing 2 pounds avoirdupois of provisions
 for each person. These provisions may be hard bread or United States
 Army ration. The receptacle shall be of metal, fitted with an opening
 in the top not less than 5 inches in diameter, properly protected by a
 screw cap made of heavy cast brass, with machine thread and an attached
 double toggle, seating to a pliable rubber gasket, which shall insure a
 tight joint, in order to properly protect the contents of the can.</p>

 <p>One canvas bag containing sailmaker's palm and needles, sail twine,
 marline, and marline spike.</p>

 <p>A water-tight metal case containing 12 self-igniting red lights capable
 of burning at least two minutes.</p>

 <p>A sea anchor.</p>

 <p>A vessel containing 1 gallon of vegetable or animal oil, so constructed
 that the oil can be easily distributed on the water and so arranged
 that it can be attached to the sea anchor.</p>

</div>

 <p>In addition to the equipment already required in lifeboats, there shall
 be provided a hand pump with a plunger of not less than 2 inches in
 diameter, and a discharge pipe of sufficient length to reach clear of
 the boat's side.</p>

 <p>Steam vessels carrying passengers and which enter the War Zone shall
 have each and every lifeboat which is carried under davits equipped
 with mast and sail and proper gear for same, as required by this
 section.</p>

<h4>Food or provisions to be carried in lifeboats.</h4>

<p>The food or provisions required to be carried in lifeboats may be
hard bread or the "United States Army Emergency Ration." Food
which produces unusual or immoderate thirst, such as corned beef,
salt fish, etc., will not be allowed, under any circumstances, as lifeboat
provisions.</p>

<p>When hard bread only is carried in the lifeboat, there must be
provided in addition thereto at least ten United States Army emergency
rations.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></div>

<h4>How lifeboats shall be carried.</h4>

<p>Lifeboats on cargo steamers shall be provided with a separate
set of davits for each lifeboat required. When this requirement
makes it necessary to install additional davits, it is recommended
that the additional davits be of the mechanical type, to facilitate
quick and safe launching. The old type of davits with "turning
out gear" is not considered as mechanical davits.</p>

<h3>Additional life-saving equipment.</h3>

<p>Cargo vessels shall carry sufficient lifeboats to accommodate every
person on board, and in addition thereto shall carry a sufficient number
of approved life rafts to accommodate at least twenty-five per
cent of the total number of persons on board.</p>

<h3>Precautionary measures.</h3>

<p>Before entering the War Zone all the lifeboats and life rafts shall
be cleared away and made ready for launching, and the master or
officer in charge, shall assure himself that all the required equipment
is in the lifeboats and life rafts, in good order, and ready for immediate
service. Steamers which are not equipped with mechanical davits
shall have all the lifeboats swung out (weather permitting) and ready
for immediate launching before entering the War Zone.</p>

<h3>Future construction.</h3>

<p>Cargo vessels contracted for after May 1, 1917, and serving trades
within the War Zone, shall be equipped on each side with lifeboats of
sufficient capacity to accommodate all persons on board based upon
an allowance of 15 cubic feet per person, and in addition thereto shall
be equipped with a sufficient number of approved life rafts to accommodate
at least twenty-five per cent of all persons on board.</p>

<h3>Handling of the boats and rafts.</h3>

<p>All the boats and rafts must be stowed in such a way that they
can be launched in the shortest possible time and that, even under
unfavorable conditions of list and trim from the point of view of the
handling of the boats and rafts, it may be possible to embark in
them as large a number of persons as possible.</p>

<p>The arrangements must be such that it may be possible to launch
on either side of the vessel as large a number of boats and rafts as
possible.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></div>

<h3>Strength and operation of the davits</h3>

<p>The davits shall be of such strength that the boats can be
lowered with their full complement of persons and equipment, the
vessel being assumed to have a list of 15 degrees.</p>

<p>The davits must be fitted with a gear of sufficient power to insure
that the boat can be turned out against the maximum list under
which the lowering of the boats is possible on the vessel in question.</p>

<p>The Secretary of Commerce is authorized by the seamen's act in
specific cases to exempt existing vessels from the requirements of
this section that the davits shall be of such strength and shall be
fitted with a gear of sufficient power to insure that the boats can be
lowered with their full complement of persons and equipment, the
vessel being assumed to have a list of 15 degrees, where their strict
application would not be practicable or reasonable.</p>

<p>Each set of davits shall have a boat of the first class attached to
it, provided that the number of open boats of the first class attached
to davits shall not be less than the minimum number fixed by
law.</p>

<p>If it is neither practicable nor reasonable to place on a vessel the
minimum number of sets of davits required, a small number of sets
of davits may be fitted, provided always that this number shall never
be less than the minimum number of open boats of the first class
required by law.</p>

<p>If a large proportion of the persons on board are accommodated
in boats whose length is greater than 50 feet, a further reduction in
the number of sets of davits may be allowed exceptionally, if the
arrangements are in all respects satisfactory.</p>

<p>In all cases in which a reduction in the minimum number of sets
of davits or other equivalent appliances required by the rules is
allowed, the owner of the vessel in question shall be required to
prove, by a test made in the presence of an officer designated by
the Supervising Inspector General, that all the boats can be efficiently
launched in a minimum time.</p>

<p>The conditions of this test shall be as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

 <p><i>First.</i> The vessel is to be upright and in smooth water.</p>

 <p><i>Second.</i> The time is the time required from the beginning of the
 removal of the boat covers, or any other operation necessary to prepare
 the boats for lowering, until the last boat or pontoon raft is afloat.</p>

 <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
 <i>Third.</i> The number of men employed in the whole operation must
 not exceed the total number of boat hands that will be carried on the
 vessel under normal service conditions.</p>

 <p><i>Fourth.</i> Each boat when being lowered must have on board at least
 two men and its full equipment as required by the rules.</p>

 <p><i>Fifth.</i> The time allowed for this test shall not exceed 10
 minutes.</p>

</div>

<h3>2 Lifeboats swung out—1 on each side.</h3>

<p>All passenger steam vessels, except those fitted with mechanical
davits, shall, when the weather permits, have one of their lifeboats
swung out on each side while at sea, brailed into a boom or rail
and ready for immediate use.</p>

<h3>Equivalents for and weight of the persons.</h3>

<p>In test for determining the number of persons which a boat
or pontoon raft can accommodate each person shall be assumed
to be an adult person wearing a life preserver.</p>

<p>In verifications of freeboard the pontoon boats shall be loaded
with a weight of at least 165 pounds for each adult person that the
pontoon boat is authorized to carry.</p>

<p>In all cases two children under 12 years of age shall be reckoned
as one person.</p>

<h3>Marking of lifeboats.</h3>

<p>All lifeboats shall have the number of boat plainly marked or
painted on each bow, in figures not less than 3 inches high. Where
lifeboats are carried on both sides of a vessel, lifeboat No. 1 shall be

<h3>Accommodations.</h3>

<p>It shall not be lawful for the master of any vessel whereon steerage
passengers have been taken at any port or place in a foreign
country or dominion (ports and places in foreign territory contiguous
to the United States excepted) to bring such vessel and passengers
to or take from any port or place in the United States unless the
compartments, spaces, and accommodations hereinafter mentioned
have been provided, allotted, maintained, and used for and by such
passengers during the entire voyage, unobstructed by cargo, stores,
or goods. The master of a vessel coming to a port or place in the
United States in violation of any of the provisions of this section shall
be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor; and if the number of steerage
passengers carried or brought in the vessel, or in any compartment,
space, poop, or deck house thereof, is greater than the number allowed
to be carried or brought therein, respectively, as hereinafter prescribed,
the said master shall be fined fifty dollars for each and every such
passenger in excess of the proper number, and may also be imprisoned
not exceeding six months.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> In computing the number of passengers carried or brought
in any vessel, children under one year of age shall not be included,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
and two children between one and eight years of age shall be counted
as one passenger; and any person brought in such vessel who shall
have been, during the voyage, taken from any other vessel wrecked or
in distress on the high seas, or have been picked up at sea from any
boat, raft, or otherwise, shall not be included in such computation.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> The expression "steerage passenger" means all passengers
except cabin passengers, and persons shall not be deemed
cabin passengers unless the space allotted to their exclusive use is
in the proportion of at least thirty-six clear superficial feet to each
passenger.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> The expression "lowest passenger deck" means the deck
next below the water line; and the expression "passenger deck"
includes every deck or portion of a deck which is above the lowest
passenger deck, and is appropriated for passengers.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> A vessel shall not carry passengers, whether cabin or
steerage passengers, on more than one deck below the water line.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> The height between that part of any deck on which steerage
passengers are carried and the deck immediately above it shall not
be less than six feet.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i> No steerage passengers shall be carried on the lowest passenger
deck unless it is efficiently lighted by side scuttles and otherwise
to the satisfaction of the inspector.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i> No greater number of steerage passengers shall be carried
on the lowest passenger deck than in the proportion of one steerage
passenger to every twenty-one clear superficial feet allotted to their
use. If, however, the height between the lowest passenger deck and
the deck immediately above it is less than seven feet, and the apertures,
exclusive of side scuttles, through which light and air are
admitted are less in size than in the proportion of three square feet
to every one hundred superficial feet of that deck, no greater number
of steerage passengers shall be carried on that deck than in the proportion
of one steerage passenger to every thirty clear superficial
feet thereof, subject to the allowance for measurement of public
rooms, lavatories, and bath rooms, if any, provided for by paragraph
ten.</p>

<p><i>Eighth.</i> No greater number of steerage passengers may be carried
on a passenger deck than in the proportion of one steerage passenger
to every eighteen clear superficial feet of deck allotted to their use,
subject to the allowance for measurement of public rooms, lavatories,
and bath rooms, if any, provided for by paragraph ten. If, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
the height between any passenger deck and the deck immediately
above it be less than seven feet, no greater number of steerage passengers
may be carried on that deck than in the proportion of one
steerage passenger to every twenty-one clear superficial feet thereof,
subject to the allowance for measurement of public rooms, lavatories,
and bath rooms, if any, provided for by paragraph ten.</p>

<p><i>Ninth.</i> A vessel, whatever be the superficial space of the passenger
decks and of the lowest passenger deck, shall not carry a
greater number of steerage passengers on the whole than in the
proportion of one steerage passenger to every five superficial feet
of air or promenade space provided on a deck so open as not to be
included in the tonnage and approved by the inspector, and this
space shall not be counted or included in the area available for any
other passengers, or in other areas for steerage passengers prescribed
by this section.</p>

<p><i>Tenth.</i> In the measurement of the passenger decks and of the
lowest passenger deck, the space occupied by that part of the personal
baggage of the steerage passengers which the inspector permits to be
carried there shall be included, and also on whatever deck located,
commodious and suitable dining rooms, lounging rooms, smoking
rooms, lavatories, toilet rooms, and bath rooms: <i>Provided</i>, That—</p>

<div class="indent2">

 <p>(<i>a</i>) The space in any place appropriated to the use of steerage
 passengers in which they sleep shall not be less than eighteen
 superficial feet in the case of the lowest passenger deck and fifteen
 superficial feet in the case of a passenger deck.</p>

 <p>(<i>b</i>) Each space so included in the measurement must be clearly
 marked to the satisfaction of the inspector as being exclusively
 appropriated for the use of the steerage passengers.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Eleventh.</i> Each separate compartment in which steerage passengers
are berthed shall be conspicuously marked, showing the total
area of such compartments. (Aug. 2,1882; Dec. 19, 1908.)</p>

</div>

<p>In every such steamship or other vessel there shall be a sufficient
number of berths for the proper accommodation as hereinafter provided,
of all such passengers. There shall not be on any deck nor
in any compartment or space occupied by such passengers more than
two tiers of berths. The berths shall be properly constructed, and
be separated from each other by partitions, as berths ordinarily are
separated, and each berth shall be at least two feet in width and six
feet in length; and the interval between the floor or lowest part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
the lower tier of berths and the deck beneath them shall not be
less than six inches, nor the interval between each tier of berths, and
the interval between the uppermost tier and the deck above it, less
than two feet six inches; and each berth shall be occupied by not
more than one passenger over eight years of age; but double berths
of twice the above-mentioned width may be provided, each double
berth to be occupied by no more and by none other than two women,
or by one woman and two children under the age of eight years,
or by husband and wife, or by a man and two of his own children
under the age of eight years, or by two men personally acquainted
with each other. All the male passengers upwards of fourteen
years of age who do not occupy berths with their wives shall be berthed
in the fore part of the vessel, in a compartment divided off from the
space or spaces appropriated to the other passengers by a substantial
and well-secured bulkhead; and unmarried female passengers shall
be berthed in a compartment separated from the spaces occupied
by other passengers by a substantial and well-constructed bulkhead,
the opening or communication from which to an adjoining
passenger space shall be so constructed that it can be closed and
secured. Families, however, shall not be separated except with
their consent. Each berth shall be numbered serially, on the outside
berth-board, according to the number of passengers that may
lawfully occupy the berth; and the berths occupied by such passengers
shall not be removed or taken down until the expiration of
twelve hours from the time of entry, unless previously inspected within
a shorter period. For any violation of either of the provisions of
this section the master of the vessel shall be liable to a fine of five
dollars for each passenger carried or brought on the vessel. (Aug. 2,
1882; sec. 2.)</p>

<h3>Light and air.</h3>

<p>Every such steamship or other vessel shall have adequate provisions
for affording light and air to the passenger-decks and to the
compartments and spaces occupied by such passengers, and with
adequate means and appliances for ventilating the said compartments
and spaces. To compartments having sufficient space for fifty or
more of such passengers at least two ventilators, each not less than
twelve inches in diameter, shall be provided, one of which ventilators
shall be inserted in the forward part of the compartment, and the
other in the after part thereof, and shall be so constructed as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
ventilate the compartment; and additional ventilators shall be provided
for each compartment in the proportion of two ventilators for
each additional fifty of such passengers carried or brought in the
compartment. All ventilators shall be carried at least six feet above
the uppermost deck of the vessel, and shall be of the most approved
form and construction. In any steamship the ventilating apparatus
provided, or any method of ventilation adopted thereon, which has
been approved by the proper emigration officers at the port or
place from which said vessel was cleared, shall be deemed a compliance
with the foregoing provisions; and in all vessels carrying
or bringing such passengers there shall be properly-constructed
hatchways over the compartments or spaces occupied by such
passengers, which hatchway shall be properly covered with houses
or booby hatches, and the coamings or sills of which shall rise at least
six inches above the deck; and there shall be proper companion-ways
or ladders from each hatchway leading to the compartments
or spaces occupied by such passengers; and the said companion-ways
or ladders shall be securely constructed, and be provided with
hand-rails or strong rope, and, when the weather will permit, such
passengers shall have the use of each hatchway situated over the
compartments or spaces appropriated to their use; and every vessel
carrying or bringing such passengers shall have a properly located and
constructed caboose and cooking-range, or other cooking apparatus,
the dimensions and capacity of which shall be sufficient to provide
for properly cooking and preparing the food of all such passengers.
In every vessel carrying or bringing such passengers there shall be
at least two water-closets or privies, and an additional water-closet
or privy for every one hundred male passengers on board, for the
exclusive use of such male passengers, and an additional water-closet
or privy for every fifty female passengers on board, for the exclusive
use of the female passengers and young children on board. The aforesaid
water-closets and privies shall be properly enclosed and located
on each side of the vessel, and shall be separated from passengers'
spaces by substantial and properly-constructed partitions or bulkheads;
and the water-closets and privies shall be kept and maintained
in a serviceable and cleanly condition throughout the voyage.
For any violation of either of the provisions of this section, or for
any neglect to conform to the requirements thereof, the master of
the vessel shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding two hundred
and fifty dollars. (Sec. 3.)</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></div>

<h3>Provisions.</h3>

<p>An allowance of good, wholesome, and proper food, with a reasonable
quantity of fresh provisions, which food shall be equal in value
to one and a half navy rations of the United States, and of fresh
water, not less than four quarts per day, shall be furnished each of
such passengers. Three meals shall be served daily, at regular and
stated hours, of which hours sufficient notice shall be given. If any
such passengers shall at any time during the voyage be put on short
allowance for food and water, the master of the vessel shall pay to
each passenger three dollars for each and every day the passenger
may have been put on short allowance, except in case of accidents,
where the captain is obliged to put the passengers on short allowance.
Mothers with infants and young children shall be furnished
the necessary quantity of wholesome milk or condensed milk for the
sustenance of the latter. Tables and seats shall be provided for the
use of passengers at regular meals. And for every willful violation
of any of the provisions of this section the master of the vessel
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more
than five hundred dollars, and be imprisoned for a term not exceeding
six months. The enforcement of this penalty, however, shall
not affect the civil responsibility of the master and owners of the
vessel to such passengers as may have suffered from any negligence,
breach of contract, or default on the part of such masters and
owners. (Sec. 4.)</p>

<h3>Medical attendance.</h3>

<p>In every such steamship or other vessel there shall be properly
built and secured, or divided off from other spaces, two compartments
or spaces to be used exclusively as hospitals for such passengers, one
for men and the other for women. The hospitals shall be located in
a space not below the deck next below the main deck of the vessel.
The hospital spaces shall in no case be less than in the proportion
of eighteen clear superficial feet for every fifty such passengers who
are carried or brought on the vessel, and such hospitals shall be
supplied with proper beds, bedding, and utensils, and be kept so
supplied throughout the voyage. And every steamship or other
vessel carrying or bringing emigrant passengers, or passengers other
than cabin passengers, exceeding fifty in number, shall carry a duly
qualified and competent surgeon or medical practitioner, who shall
be rated as such in the ship's articles, and who shall be provided with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
surgical instruments, medical comforts, and medicines proper and
necessary for diseases and accidents incident to sea-voyages, and for
the proper medical treatment of such passengers during the voyage,
and with such articles of food and nourishment as may be proper
and necessary for preserving the health of infants and young children;
and the services of such surgeon or medical practitioner shall be
promptly given, in any case of sickness or disease, to any of the
passengers, or to any infant or young child of any such passengers,
who may need his services. For a violation of either of the provisions
of this section the master of the vessel shall be liable to a penalty
not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars. (Sec. 5.)</p>

<h3>Discipline and cleanliness.</h3>

<p>The master of every such steamship or other vessel is authorized
to maintain good discipline and such habits of cleanliness among such
passengers as will tend to the preservation and promotion of health,
and to that end he shall cause such regulations as he may adopt
for such purpose to be posted up on board the vessel, in a place or
places accessible to such passengers, and shall keep the same so posted
up during the voyage. The said master shall cause the compartments
and spaces provided for, or occupied by, such passengers to
be kept at all times in a clean and healthy condition, and to be, as
often as may be necessary, disinfected with chloride of lime, or by
some other equally efficient disinfectant. Whenever the state
of the weather will permit, such passengers and their bedding shall
be mustered on deck, and a clear and sufficient space on the main
or any upper deck of the vessel shall be set apart, and so kept, for
the use and exercise of such passengers during the voyage. For
each neglect or violation of any of the provisions of this section the
master of the vessel shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding two
hundred and fifty dollars. (Sec. 6.)</p>

<h3>Privacy of passengers.</h3>

<p>Neither the officers, seamen, nor other persons employed on any
such steamship or other vessel shall visit or frequent any part of the
vessel provided or assigned to the use of such passengers, except by
the direction or permission of the master of such vessel first made or
given for such purpose; and every officer, seaman, or other person
employed on board of such vessel who shall violate the provisions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and may
be fined not exceeding one hundred dollars, and be imprisoned not
exceeding twenty days, for each violation; and the master of such
vessel who directs or permits any officer, seaman, or other person
employed on board the vessel to visit or frequent any part of the
vessel provided for or assigned to the use of such passengers, or the
compartments or spaces occupied by such passengers, except for the
purpose of doing or performing some necessary act or duty as an
officer, seaman, or other person employed on board of the vessel,
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and may be fined not more
than one hundred dollars for each time he directs or permits the provisions
of this section to be violated. A copy of this section, written
or printed in the language or principal languages of the passengers
on board, shall, by or under the direction of the master of the vessel,
be posted in a conspicuous place on the forecastle and in the several
parts of the vessel provided and assigned for the use of such
passengers, and in each compartment or space occupied by such
passengers, and the same shall be kept so posted during the
voyage; and if the said master neglects so to do, he shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be fined not more
than one hundred dollars. (Sec. 7.)</p>

<h3>Explosives; cattle.</h3>

<p>It shall not be lawful to take, carry, or have on board of any
such steamship or other vessel any nitro-glycerine, dynamite, or any
other explosive article or compound, nor any vitriol or like acids, nor
gunpowder, except for the ship's use, nor any article or number of
articles, whether as a cargo or ballast, which, by reason of the nature
or quantity or mode of storage thereof, shall, either singly or collectively,
be likely to endanger the health or lives of the passengers
or the safety of the vessel, and horses, cattle, or other animals taken
on board of or brought in any such vessel shall not be carried on any
deck below the deck on which passengers are berthed, nor in any
compartment in which passengers are berthed, nor in any adjoining
compartment except in a vessel built of iron, and of which the compartments
are divided off by water-tight bulkheads extending to the
upper deck. For every violation of any of the provisions of this section
the master of the vessel shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
and shall be fined not exceeding one thousand dollars, and be imprisoned
for a period not exceeding one year. (Sec. 8.)</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></div>

<h3>Boarding vessel; passenger list.</h3>

<p>It shall not be lawful for the master of any such steamship or
other vessel, not in distress, after the arrival of the vessel within any
collection district of the United States, to allow any person or persons
except a pilot, officer of the customs, or health officer, agents of the
vessel, and consuls, to come on board of the vessel, or to leave the
vessel, until the vessel has been taken in charge by an officer of the
customs, nor, after charge so taken, without leave of such officer,
until all the passengers, with their baggage, have been duly landed
from the vessel; and on the arrival of any such steamship or other
vessel within any collection district of the United States, the master
shall submit for inspection to the officer of customs who first makes
demand therefor, and shall subsequently deliver with his manifest
of cargo on entry, a correct list, signed and verified on oath by the
master, of all passengers taken on board the vessel at any foreign
port or place, specifying, in the manner to be prescribed from time
to time by the Secretary of Commerce, the name of each passenger,
age (if a child of eight years or under), sex, married or single, location
of compartment or space occupied during the voyage (if the
passenger be other than a cabin passenger), whether a citizen of the
United States, number of pieces of baggage, and if any passenger
die on the voyage the list shall specify the name, age, and cause of
death of each deceased passenger. For a violation of either of the
provisions of this section, or for permitting or neglecting to prevent a
violation thereof, the master of the vessel shall be liable to a fine
not exceeding one thousand dollars. (Feb. 9, 1905; sec. 9.)</p>

<p>The Secretary of Commerce is hereby authorized and directed
to prescribe from time to time and enforce regulations governing
the boarding of vessels arriving at the seaports of the United States,
before such vessels have been properly inspected and placed in
security, and for that purpose to employ any of the officers of that
Department. (Mar. 31, 1900; Feb. 14, 1903; sec. 10.)</p>

<p>Each person violating such regulations shall be subject to a
penalty of not more than one hundred dollars or imprisonment not
to exceed six months, or both, in the discretion of the court. (Mar.
31,  1900; sec. 2.)</p>

<p>This Act shall be construed as supplementary to section nine of
chapter three hundred and seventy-four of the Statutes of eighteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
hundred and eighty-two, and section forty-six hundred and six of
the Revised Statutes, (sec. 3.)</p>

<p>Each and every collector of customs to whom shall be delivered
the manifests or lists of passengers prescribed by the twelfth section
of the act aforesaid, approved March third, eighteen hundred and
fifty-five, shall make returns from such manifests or lists of passengers
to the Secretary of Commerce of the United States, in such manner
as shall be prescribed by that officer, under whose direction statements
of the same shall be prepared and published. (May. 7, 1874;
Feb. 14, 1903; sec. 10.)</p>

<h3>Death of passenger.</h3>

<p>In case there shall have occurred on board any such steamship
or other vessel any death among such passengers during the voyage,
the master or consignees of the vessel shall, within forty-eight hours
after the arrival of the vessel within a collection district of the United
States, or within twenty-four hours after the entry of the vessel, pay
to the collector of customs of such district the sum of ten dollars
for each and every such passenger above the age of eight years who
shall have died on the voyage by natural disease; and the master or
consignees of any vessel who neglect or refuse to pay such collector,
within the times hereinbefore prescribed, the sums of money aforesaid,
shall be liable to a penalty of fifty dollars in addition to the sum
required to be paid as aforesaid for each passenger whose death
occurred on the voyage. All sums of money paid to any collector
under the provisions of this section shall be by him paid into the
Treasury of the United States in such manner and under such regulations
as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
(Aug. 2, 1882; sec. 10.)</p>

<h3>Inspection.</h3>

<p>The collector of customs of the collection district within which,
or the surveyor of the port at which, any such steamship or other
vessel arrives, shall direct an inspector or other officer of the customs
to make an examination of the vessel, and to admeasure the compartments
or spaces occupied by the emigrant passengers, or passengers
other than cabin passengers, during the voyage; and such measurement
shall be made in the manner provided by law for admeasuring
vessels for tonnage; and to compare the number of such passengers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
found on board with the list of such passengers furnished by the master
to the customs officer; and the said inspector or other officer shall
make a report to the aforesaid collector or surveyor, stating the port
of departure, the time of sailing, the length of the voyage, the ventilation,
the number of such passengers on board the vessel, and their
native country, respectively; the cubic quantity of each compartment
or space, and the number of berths and passengers in each
space, the kind and quality of the food furnished to such passengers
on the voyage; the number of deaths, and the age and sex of those
who died during the voyage, and of what disease; and in case there
was any unusual sickness or mortality during the voyage, to report
whether the same was caused by any neglect or violation of the
provisions of this act, or by the want of proper care against disease
by the master or owners of the vessel; and the said reports shall be
forwarded to the Secretary of Commerce at such times and in such
manner as he shall direct. (Feb. 14, 1903; sec. 10.)</p>

<h3>Penalties.</h3>

<p>The provisions of this act shall apply to every steamship or other
vessel whereon emigrant passengers, or passengers other than cabin
passengers are taken on board at a port or place in the United States
for conveyance to any port or place in a foreign country except
foreign territory contiguous to the United States, and shall also
apply to any vessel whereon such passengers are taken on board at
any port or place of the United States on the Atlantic Ocean or its
tributaries for conveyance to a port or place on the Pacific Ocean
or its tributaries, or vice versa; and whether the voyage of said
vessel is to be continuous from port to port or such passengers are
to be conveyed from port to port in part by the way of any overland
route through Mexico or Central America; and the said collector
of customs may direct an examination of the vessel to be made by
an inspector or other officer of the customs, who shall make the
examination and report whether the provisions of this act have been
complied with in respect to such vessel, and the said collector is
authorized to withhold the clearance of such vessel until the coming
in of such report; and if the said report shall show that any of the
provisions of this act have not been complied with, the collector is
authorized and directed to withhold the clearance of such vessel
until the said provisions are complied with, and if any such vessel
leaves the aforesaid port or place without having been duly cleared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
by the collector of customs, the master shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and may be fined not exceeding one thousand dollars,
and be imprisoned not exceeding one year, and the vessel shall be
liable to seizure and forfeiture. (Aug. 2, 1882; sec. 12.)</p>

<p>The amount of the several fines and penalties imposed by any
section of this act upon the master of any steamship or other vessel
carrying or bringing emigrant passengers, or passengers other than
cabin passengers, for any violation of the provisions of this act, shall
be liens upon such vessel, and such vessel may be libeled therefor in
any district court of the United States where such vessel shall arrive
or depart. (Sec. 13.)</p>

<h3>Carriage of passengers.</h3>

<p>The inspectors shall state in every certificate of inspection granted
to steamers carrying passengers, other than ferryboats, the number
of passengers of each class that any such steamer has accommodations

<p>It shall not be lawful to take on board of any steamer a greater
number of passengers than is stated in the certificate of inspection;
and for every violation of this provision the master or owner shall
be liable, to any person suing for the same, to forfeit the amount of
passage-money and ten dollars for each passenger beyond the number
allowed. (R. S., 4465.)</p>

<p>Every steam vessel licensed under the foregoing section shall carry

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
THE SECOND MATE</h2>

<p><b>Watches.</b> The Second Mate of an ocean steamer is
always a watch officer, that is, he is in responsible charge of
a watch at sea, and where the Chief, Second, and Third
Mates, stand the watches, his watch is generally taken from
Noon until 4 <small>P.M.</small>, and from Midnight to 4 <small>A.M.</small>, or he
stands the afternoon and the mid watches.</p>

<p><b>Hold Duty.</b> The Second Mate is in charge of the after
holds. His duties, under the Chief Mate, are those outlined
in the duties and responsibilities of that officer. The Second
Mate is the understudy of the Chief Mate and should diligently
prepare himself to take up the work of that position.
The Second Mate who is fortunate enough to be shipmates
with a top-notch first officer, should improve every opportunity
to study his superior and to perfect himself in the
difficult duty of the station next ahead.</p>

<p><b>Coming Alongside.</b> In coming alongside, coming to
anchor, docking, etc., the Second Mate is in charge aft.</p>

<p>He should note the clearance of the propellers, and should
promptly report by voice or telegraph, or by messenger,
when anything in his end of the ship requires the attention
of the Master on the bridge.</p>

<p>A quartermaster, with semaphore flags, is a handy means
of communicating with the bridge while docking. Red and
white lights are sometimes used while docking at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
The station aft is in many respects the most important
in the vessel while coming along side, and intelligent handling
of the lines and men soon stamps an officer as well qualified
in his profession.</p>

<p>He should use judgment in sending ashore, or "heaving,"
small lines, as the attempt to put a heaving line across too
great a distance often results in dangerous delays, and leads
to confusion.</p>

<p>He should see the cork fenders handy, with men told
off to handle them. He should study the men assigned to
his end of the ship and place only reliable men at the capstans
and bits. A man who can properly "surge" a seven-inch
line, under heavy strain is a rarity these days.</p>

<p>He should understand, and have men ready, for the
throwing in and operating of the hand-steering gear in case
of emergency.</p>

<p><b>Cargo Gear.</b> The after cargo gear, is generally under the
charge of the Second Mate, and he is in charge of the opening
and closing of the after cargo hatches.</p>

<p><b>Baggage.</b> The Second Mate is generally in charge of the
handling and care of heavy baggage, in vessels in the passenger
trade. This is important duty, and calls for care and
dispatch. Such baggage is whipped ashore as fast as possible
so that the customs inspectors are not delayed.</p>

<p><b>Mail.</b> The Second Mate is also charged with the handling
and stowage of the mail sacks—unless in a very large
liner where special mail clerks attend to this duty.</p>

<p><b>Navigating Officer.</b> The Second Mate is sometimes designated
the "Navigating Officer," that is, he is charged with
the special care of the navigating equipment. Corrects
charts from the "Notices to Mariners" and assists the
Master generally in the navigating duty. He may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
required to wind the chronometers each morning at eight
bells and report them wound to the Master, though when
standing the mid watch, this duty is usually attended to by
the Master himself, who, in the Merchant Service is the
responsible navigating officer of his vessel.</p>

<p>The Second Mate corrects the ship's clocks for difference
of Longitude to noon.</p>

<p>However, the naming of the Second Mate, as navigating
officer has much to commend it. He then has special duties,
and is charged with the complete supervision of the compasses,
sounding machines, instruments, lead lines, patent
logs and log lines. He should perfect himself in the science
of navigation and master the simple (and to many) mysterious
principles of compass adjustment. He should be in
charge of the deviation log and prepare the deviation tables
for each loading and voyage.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
THE THIRD MATE</h2>

<p><b>Watches.</b> The Third Mate of an ocean steamer is generally
a watch officer. If the vessel is of any size, and the
three mates stand watch, the watch from eight to noon and
from eight to midnight, is usually assigned to the Third
Mate. This is one of the best watches, and the watch during
which the Master is most likely to be up and about. As
the junior watch officer is the least experienced, it is best
that he have the Master close at hand in the event of anything
unusual occurring.</p>

<p><b>Hold Duty.</b> The Third Mate is generally given charge
of the forward holds, under the immediate supervision of
the Chief Mate. Here his duties are those outlined in the
chapter headed Chief Mate. He is directly under the mate
and should use every effort to familiarize himself with his
duties and with the vessel. He should carry out all orders
to the letter, and aim to perfect himself in the many branches
of seamanship and navigation. The duty to cargo, and the
hold duty is one of his most important charges.</p>

<p><b>Coming Alongside.</b> When coming alongside, or to
anchor, or when docking, the Third Mate is stationed on the
bridge with the Master. He usually attends to the telegraph,
cons the quartermaster at the wheel and looks out
for the work on the bridge generally. This post is one of
special importance for the young officer as he gets, from
close observation, a splendid opportunity to observe and
learn the details of ship handling. He sees the mistakes made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
fore and aft, in the handling of lines, etc., and can, if he
will, profit by this experience.</p>

<p><b>Gangway.</b> The Third Mate is usually charged with the
getting in and out of the gangway, and with the safe embarkation
of passengers. He must keep order, and note who
comes on board, and what their business is while the vessel
is being permanently secured or anchored, and before the
regular gangway watch is set.</p>

<p><b>Signal Officer.</b> While the duty is not generally assigned,
it is a good plan to designate the Third Mate as "Signal
Officer." This charges him with the care and use of the
signal flags and other apparatus, and he should perfect himself
in their rapid and accurate use.</p>

<p>The Third Mate should master the hand semaphore
signals and should see that at least two of the quartermasters
are adept at this form of communication. Such knowledge
is of the greatest use when in convoy with men-of-war, and
can be made use of in a hundred different ways while lying
at anchor, or when communicating with other vessels or
the shore. So many seamen are now familiar with the
semaphore alphabet that it has become one of the handiest
means of talking at sea over moderate distances, and its use
at once stamps a vessel as being up to time.</p>

<p>He should also know the Morse Code and be able to send
and read by the blinker or Morse lamp.</p>

<p>This is used in convoy work instead of wireless.</p>

<p><b>Bridge.</b> The bridge, and the duties of the quartermasters
on the bridge and bridge deck, are generally delegated to
the Third Mate, or to any officer who may be junior to him.
This means general upkeep and order. A well-regulated and
well-kept up bridge is a joy—the reverse is all too common.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
THE JUNIOR OFFICERS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> vessels now carry one or more junior officers, young
men who have some sea experience and who have prepared
themselves to a certain extent in navigation. Many of them
come on board ship with a very hazy idea as to what it is
all about. They are willing enough, but don't know where
to begin. They would be glad to tail onto the starboard
main t'gallant buntline, but don't know just where it is.</p>

<p>For such as these, the following random <b>Things to Do</b>
and to learn about are suggested:</p>

<div class="bold">

<p>Do the things you are told to do, then—</p>

<p>1. Find our what quartermasters are doing.</p>

<p>2. Look after hand leads and lines, are they marked correctly—accurately?</p>

<p>3. See that log is ready for streaming, as soon as past the
light ship, or other mark.</p>

<p>4. Find switch for running lights—are they in order?</p>

<p>5. Look up log book, see how it is kept, and if up to date.</p>

<p>6. See that note book on the bridge is handy.</p>

<p>7. See if the clock in the wheel house and chart room is
correct.</p>

<p>8. Work up the chronometer error.</p>

<p>9. See that the bridge dodgers are properly bent, and are
clean.</p>

<p>10. See that the binoculars and telescopes on the bridge
are in their proper places and are clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
11. Find out where the Coston lights are kept.</p>

<p>12. Find out what are red and what are blue lights, how
many on board?</p>

<p>13. See that the binnacle lights are in working order.</p>

<p>14. See that the automatic fog whistle control works;
how often does it blow when set—is it according to law?</p>

<p>15. See if the whistle works, don't pull it unless the Chief
Mate or the Master says so.</p>

<p>16. Try out the engine room telegraph—the docking telegraph—after
notifying the Chief that you intend doing so and
on order of the Mate or Master.</p>

<p>17. Find out what kind of signals are used between the
crow's nest and the bridge. The fo'c'sle head and the bridge.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
CADETS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> the laws establishing an ocean mail service certain
vessels so engaged are required to carry cadets.</p>

<p>Excerpts from this law follow:</p>

<p class="small center">"OCEAN MAIL SERVICE</p>

<p class="small">"Said vessels shall take, as cadets or apprentices, one American-born
boy, under twenty-one years of age for each one thousand
tons gross register, and one for each majority fraction thereof, who
shall be educated in the duties of seamanship, rank as petty officers,
and receive such pay for their services as may be reasonable."</p>

<p>The system of carrying cadets is sound in principle, but
in many instances the law has been carried out according
to a peculiar interpretation of the phrase "<b>Shall be educated
in the duties of seamanship</b>."</p>

<p>Education is a term of wide meaning, but "seamanship"
or the "Duties of Seamanship" is at least fairly definite.
The whole cadet system should be put upon a definite basis
of regular instruction, or else be done away with.</p>

<p>Many of us can remember a scouting party hurrying
across West Street to pick up a "cadet" or two, so the
good ship could go to sea in full compliance with the law.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
LAWS DEFINING OFFICERS OF MERCHANT VESSELS</h2>

<h3>Citizenship of officers.</h3>

<p>All the officers of vessels of the United States who shall have charge
of a watch, including pilots, shall in all cases be citizens of the United
States. [Metlakahtla Indians excepted by act, March 4, 1907.]
(R. S., 4131.)</p>

<p>The word "officers" shall include the chief engineer and each
assistant engineer in charge of a watch on vessels propelled wholly
or in part by steam; and after the first day of January, eighteen
hundred and ninety-seven, no person shall be qualified to hold a
license as a commander or watch officer of a merchant vessel of the
United States who is not a native-born citizen, or whose naturalization
as a citizen shall not have been fully completed. (May 28,
1896; sec. 1.)</p>

<p>In cases where on a foreign voyage, or on a voyage from an Atlantic
to a Pacific port of the United States, any such vessel is for any
reason deprived of the services of an officer below the grade of master,
his place, or a vacancy caused by the promotion of another officer to
such place, may be supplied by a person not a citizen of the United
States until the first return of such vessel to its home port; and such
vessel shall not be liable to any penalty or penal tax for such employment
of an alien officer. (June 26, 1884; sec. 1; May 28, 1896;
sec. 3.)</p>

<p>The President of the United States is hereby authorized, whenever
in his discretion the needs of foreign commerce may require,
to suspend by order, so far and for such length of time as he may deem
desirable, the provisions of law prescribing that all the watch officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
of vessels of the United States registered for foreign trade shall be
citizens of the United States. (Aug. 18, 1914; sec. 2.)</p>

<div class="gesperrt center">******</div>

<p>The provisions of law prescribing that the watch officers of vessels
of the United States registered for foreign trade shall be citizens of
the United States are hereby suspended so far and for such length of
time as is herein provided, namely: All foreign-built ships which shall
be admitted to United States registry under said act may retain the
watch officers employed thereon, without regard to citizenship, for
seven years from this date, and such watch officers shall be eligible
for promotion. Any vacancy occurring among such watch officers
within two years from this date may be filled without regard to
citizenship; but any vacancy which may occur thereafter shall be
filled by a watch officer who is a citizen of the United
States.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;
(Executive order, Sept. 4, 1914.)</p>

<h3>Watch officers who are not citizens.</h3>

<div class="indent">

 <p>Executive order of Sept. 1, 1916:</p>

 <p>1. The provisions of the law prescribing that the watch officers of
 vessels of the United States registered for foreign trade shall be
 citizens of the United States, are hereby suspended so far and for such
 length of time as is herein provided, namely: All watch officers now
 employed on foreign-built ships which have been admitted to United
 States registry under said Act who, heretofore, have declared their
 intention to become citizens of the United States and watch officers on
 such ships who, within six months from this date, shall declare their
 intention to become such citizens shall be entitled to serve on
 foreign-built ships so registered until the time shall have expired
 within which they may become such citizens under their declarations,
 and shall be eligible for promotion upon any foreign-built ship so
 registered.</p>

</div>

<h3>Duration of licenses.</h3>

<p>All licenses issued to such officers shall be for a term of five years,
but the holder of a license may have the same renewed for another
five years in the manner prescribed in the rules and regulations of the
Board of Supervising Inspectors: <i>Provided, however</i>, That any officer
holding a license, and who is engaged in a service which necessitates
his continuous absence from the United States, may make application
in writing for renewal and transmit the same to the board of
local inspectors, with his certificate of citizenship, if naturalized, and
a statement of the applicant, verified before a consul or other officer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
of the United States authorized to administer an oath, setting forth
the reasons for not appearing in person; and upon receiving the same
the board of local inspectors that originally issued such license shall
renew the same and shall notify the applicant of such renewal:
<i>Provided further</i>, That no license as master, mate, or pilot of any class
of vessel shall be renewed without furnishing a satisfactory certificate
of examination as to color blindness. And in all cases where
the issue is the suspension or revocation of such licenses, whether
before the local boards of inspectors (of steam vessels), as provided
for in section forty-four hundred and fifty of the Revised Statutes,
or before the supervising inspectors, as provided for in section forty-four
hundred and fifty-two of the Revised Statutes, the accused shall
be allowed to appear by counsel and to testify in his own behalf.
(May 28, 1896; sec. 2; Oct. 22, 1914.)</p>

<h3>Service during war.</h3>

<p>No master, mate, pilot, or engineer of steam vessels licensed under
title fifty-two [R. S., 4399-4500] of the Revised Statutes shall be liable
to draft in time of war, except for the performance of duties such as
required by his license; and, while performing such duties in the
service of the United States, every such master, mate, pilot, or
engineer shall be entitled to the highest rate of wages paid in the merchant
marine of the United States for similar services; and, if killed

<h3>Officer's license.</h3>

<p>The boards of local inspectors shall license and classify the masters,
chief mates, and second and third mates, if in charge of a watch,
engineers, and pilots of all steam vessels, and the masters of sail
vessels of over seven hundred gross tons, and all other vessels of over
one hundred gross tons carrying passengers for hire. It shall be
unlawful to employ any person, or for any person to serve, as a

of any sail vessel of over seven hundred gross tons, or of any
other vessel of over one hundred gross tons carrying passengers

<p>Every master, mate, engineer, and pilot who shall receive a
license shall, when employed upon any vessel, within forty-eight hours
after going on duty, place his certificate of license, which shall be

it can be seen by passengers and others at all times: <i>Provided</i>, That
in case of emergency such officer may be transferred to another
vessel of the same owners for a period not exceeding forty-eight
hours without the transfer of his license to such other vessel; and
for every neglect to comply with this provision by any such master,
mate, engineer, or pilot, he shall be subject to a fine of one hundred
dollars, or to the revocation of his license. [See act June 9, 1910,
p. 351.] (R. S., 4446; Feb. 19, 1907.)</p>

<h3>Master's license.</h3>

<p>Whenever any person applies to be licensed as master of any
steam vessel, or of a sail vessel of over seven hundred tons, the inspectors
shall make diligent inquiry as to his character, and shall carefully
examine the applicant as well as the proofs which he presents
in support of his claim, and if they are satisfied that his capacity,
experience, habits of life, and character are such as warrant the
belief that he can safely be intrusted with the duties and responsibilities
of the station for which he makes application, they shall
grant him a license authorizing him to discharge such duties on any
such vessel for the term of five years; but such license shall be suspended
or revoked upon satisfactory proof of bad conduct, intemperate
habits, incapacity, inattention to his duties, or the willful
violation of any provision of this title [R. S., 4399-4500] applicable
to him. [See act June 9, 1910, p. 351.] (R. S., 4439; Dec. 21,
1898; sec. 2.)</p>

<p>Whenever any person applies for authority to be employed as
chief mate of ocean or coastwise steam vessels or of sail vessels of

steam vessels, who shall have charge of a watch, or whenever
any person applies for authority to be employed as mate of river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
steamers, the inspectors shall require satisfactory evidence of the
knowledge, experience, and skill of the applicant in lading cargo
and in handling and stowage of freight, and if for license as chief
mate on ocean or coastwise steamers, or of sail vessels of over seven
hundred tons, or as second or third mate of ocean or coastwise
steamers, who shall have charge of a watch, shall also examine him
as to his knowledge and ability in navigation and managing such
vessels and all other duties pertaining to his station, and if satisfied
of his qualifications and good character they shall grant him a license
authorizing him to perform such duties for the term of five years upon
the waters upon which he is found qualified to act; but such license
shall be suspended or revoked upon satisfactory proof of bad conduct,
intemperate habits, unskillfulness, or want of knowledge of the
duties of his station or the willful violation of any provision of this
title [R. S., 4399-4500]. [See act June 9,1910, p. 351.] (R. S., 444c;
Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 3.)</p>

<h3>Engineer's license.</h3>

<p>Whenever any person applies for authority to perform the duties
of engineer of any steam-vessel, the inspectors shall examine the
applicant as to his knowledge of steam-machinery, and his experience
as an engineer, and also the proofs which he produces in support
of his claim; and if, upon full consideration, they are satisfied that
his character, habits of life, knowledge, and experience in the duties
of an engineer are all such as to authorize the belief that he is a
suitable and safe person to be intrusted with the powers and duties
of such a station, they shall grant him a license, authorizing him to
be employed in such duties for the term of five years, in which they
shall assign him to the appropriate class of engineers; but such
license shall be suspended or revoked upon satisfactory proof of
negligence, unskillfulness, intemperance, or the willful violation of
any provision of this Title [R. S., 4399-4500]. Whenever complaint
is made against any engineer holding a license authorizing him to
take charge of the boilers and machinery of any steamer, that he has,
through negligence or want of skill, permitted the boilers in his
charge to burn or otherwise become in bad condition, or that he has
not kept his engine and machinery in good working order, it shall
be the duty of the inspectors, upon satisfactory proof of such negligence
or want of skill, to revoke the license of such engineer and
assign him to a lower grade or class of engineers, if they find him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
fitted therefor. [See act June 9, 1910, p. 351.] (R. S., 4441; May
28, 1896.)</p>

<h3>Pilot's license.</h3>

<p>Whenever any person claiming to be a skillful pilot of steam-vessels
offers himself for a license, the inspectors shall make diligent
inquiry as to his character and merits, and if satisfied, from personal
examination of the applicant, with the proof that he offers that he
possesses the requisite knowledge and skill, and is trustworthy and
faithful, they shall grant him a license for the term of five years to
pilot any such vessel within the limits prescribed in the license; but
such license shall be suspended or revoked upon satisfactory evidence
of negligence, unskillfulness, inattention to the duties of his station,
or intemperance, or the willful violation of any provision of this title
[R. S., 4399-4500]. [See act June 9, 1910, p. 351.] (R. S., 4442;
May 28, 1896.)</p>

<h3>Master or mate acting as pilot.</h3>

<p>Where the master or mate is also pilot of the vessel, he shall not
be required to hold two licenses to perform such duties, but the license
issued shall state on its face that he is authorized to act in such double
capacity. [See act June 9, p. 351.] (R. S., 4443.)</p>

<h3>Oath of officer.</h3>

<p>Every master, chief mate, engineer, and pilot, who receives a
license, shall, before entering upon his duties, make oath before one
of the inspectors herein provided for, to be recorded with the certificate,
that he will faithfully and honestly, according to his best
skill and judgment, without concealment or reservation, perform all
the duties required of him by law. (R. S., 4445.)</p>

<p>Every applicant for license as either master, mate, pilot, or engineer
under the provisions of this title [R. S., 4399-4500] shall make and
subscribe to an oath of affirmation, before one of the inspectors
referred to in this title, to the truth of all the statements set forth
in his application for such license.</p>

<p>Any person who shall make or subscribe to any oath or affirmation
authorized in this title and knowing the same to be false shall be
deemed guilty of perjury.</p>

<p>Every licensed master, mate, pilot, or engineer who shall change,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
by addition, interpolation, or erasure of any kind, any certificate or
license issued by any inspector or inspectors referred to in this title
shall, for every such offense, upon conviction, be punished by a fine
of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment at hard
labor for a term not exceeding three years. (Mar. 23, 1900.)</p>

<h3>Removal of master.</h3>

<p>Any person or body corporate having more than one-half ownership
of any vessel shall have the power to remove a master, who is
also part owner of such vessel, as such majority owners have to
remove a master not an owner. This section shall not apply where
there is a valid written agreement subsisting, by virtue of which
such master would be entitled to possession, nor in any case where
a master has possession as part owner, obtained before the ninth day
of April, eighteen hundred and seventy-two. (R. S., 4250.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
THE EXAMINATION FOR LICENSES—MASTER AND MATES</h2>

<h3>Original Licenses.</h3>

<p>Before an original license is issued to any person to act as a master,
mate, pilot, or engineer he shall personally appear before some
local board or a supervising inspector for examination. Any person
who has attained the age of 19 years and has had the necessary
experience shall be eligible for examination: <i>Provided</i>, That no person
shall receive a license as master or chief engineer before reaching the
age of 21 years.</p>

<p>Inspectors shall, before granting an original license to any person
to act as an officer of a vessel, require the applicant to make written
application upon the blank form furnished by the Department of
Commerce, to be filed in the inspectors' office. When practicable,
applicants for master's, mate's, pilot's, or engineer's license shall
present to the inspectors, to be filed with their application, discharges
or letters from the master or other officer under whom they have
served, certifying to the name of the vessel and in what capacity the
applicant has served under him; also period of such service. Inspectors
shall also, when practicable, require applicant for pilot's license
to have the written indorsement of the master and engineer of the
vessel upon which he has served, and of one licensed pilot, as to his
qualifications. In the case of applicants for original engineer's
license, they shall also, when practicable, have the indorsement of
the master and engineer of a vessel on which they have served,
together with one other licensed engineer.</p>

<p>The first license issued to any person by a United States inspector
shall be considered an original license, where the United States
records show no previous issue to such applicant.</p>

<p>No original license shall be issued to any naturalized citizen on
less experience in any grade than would have been required of a citizen
of the United States by birth. (R. S., 4405.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
The requirements for a license have been greatly modified,
and the following circular letter sets forth the minimum
technical knowledge necessary to pass the examiners:</p>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right1">June 13, 1917.</div>
</div>

<p class="center">U. S. Supervising and Local Inspectors, Steamboat-Inspection Service.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of Section 4405, Revised Statutes of the United
States, as amended by the act of Congress approved February 8, 1907, the
executive committee of the Board of Supervising Inspectors,
Steamboat-Inspection Service, at a called meeting held in Washington, D.
C., from June 4 to 12, inclusive, 1917, adopted the following
resolutions:</p>

<p>These amendments of the rules, having received the approval of the
Secretary of Commerce on June 12, 1917, have now the force of law, and
must be observed accordingly.</p>

<h3>Renewal of licenses.</h3>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That section 8, Rule V, General Rules and Regulations,
all classes, be struck out and the following substituted therefor:</p>

<p>8.  Whenever an officer shall apply for a renewal of his license
for the same grade, the presentation of the old license with oath of
officer shall be considered sufficient evidence of his title to renewal,
which old license and oath of office shall be retained by the inspectors
upon their official files as the evidence upon which the license was
renewed.</p>

<p>Whenever a licensed officer makes application for a renewal of
his license, he shall appear in person before some board of local
inspectors or supervising inspector, except that upon renewal of such
license for the same grade, when the distance from any local board
or supervising inspector is such as to put the person holding the same
to great inconvenience and expense to appear in person, he may, upon
taking oath of office before any person authorized to administer
oaths, and forwarding the same, together with the license to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
renewed, to the local board or supervising inspector of the district in
which he resides or is employed, have the same renewed by the said
inspectors, if no valid reason to the contrary be known to them;
and they shall attach such oath to the stub end of the license, which
is to be retained on file in their office: <i>Provided, however</i>, That any
officer holding a license, and who is engaged in a service which necessitates
his continuous absence from the United States, may make application
in writing for renewal and transmit the same to the board of
local inspectors, with its certificate of citizenship, if naturalized, and
a statement of the applicant, verified before a consul or other officer
of the United States authorized to administer an oath, setting forth
the reasons for not appearing in person; and upon receiving the
same the board of local inspectors that originally issued such license
shall renew the same and shall notify the applicant of such renewal,
and no license as master, mate, or pilot of any class of vessel shall be
renewed without a certificate that the color sense of the applicant is
normal. (R. S., 4405, 4438.)</p>

<h3>Amendments of general rules and regulations, ocean and coastwise.</h3>

<p><i>Resolved</i>: That sections 20 to 30, both inclusive, Rule V, General
Rules and Regulations, Ocean and Coastwise, be struck out and the
following substituted therefor:</p>

<h3>Substituting service in next lower grade for raise of grade.</h3>

<p>20. Except as hereinafter provided, an applicant who has served
in a lower grade than that for which he is licensed may substitute
service in the grade next below that for which he is licensed, which
service shall count one-half in computing experience for raise of grade.
For example, if an applicant holds chief mate's license and has served
nine months as chief mate and six months as second mate, the six
months' service as second mate shall count as three months as chief
mate in computing experience.</p>

<h3>Master of ocean steam vessels.</h3>

<p>21. An applicant for license as master of ocean steam vessels
shall be eligible for examination after he has furnished satisfactory

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
THE WATCH OFFICER</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Officer of the Watch or the Watch Officer, as he
is usually termed in the Merchant Service, is the deck officer
who has charge of the vessel while under way at sea. On
other occasions, if stopped through trouble, or because of
communication with other vessels, or on occasions requiring
special maneuvering, as in coming in and out of port, rescues
at sea, etc., the Master assumes full charge.</p>

<p><b>The Watch Officers.</b> The watch officers are usually the
Chief, Second and Third Mates, on vessels of moderate
tonnage. In larger craft different watches are arranged.
Then the Chief Mate may stand no regular bridge watch,
and the Second, Third, and Fourth Mates take this duty.</p>

<p>In some liners it is the custom to style the watch officers,
all "second" officers; namely Senior, Junior, and Extra,
Second Officers. These are usually all master mariners.
Junior officers of the watch are also on the bridge, attend
to the conning of the course, the working of navigation and
bearings, and the keeping of the bridge log, which is signed
by the senior watch officer at the end of the watch.</p>

<p><b>Importance of Watch Duty.</b> For a long time a slipshod
method of keeping watch prevailed in certain steamers, the
outgrowth of second-rate sailing-ship practice, where thrifty,
but ill-informed, masters, insisted on their watch officers
keeping "busy" during the day.</p>

<p>It was thought advisable by these gentlemen to have the
officer on the bridge "with nothing to do" attend to a bit
of sewing on canvas, or help out with the painting, and what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
not. Of course such masters were doomed to the scrap heap
where they belong. A few miles added to the coal bill,
through slovenly daytime steering, with kinks in the course
as well as in the seams sewed by the misused officer, soon
brought about reform. Added to this a certain danger, such
as running down submerged hulls, and the like—with the
thing happening once or twice, helped to wake up owners.
Also, the bumping of two of these "economical" (and
lubberly) craft, may have helped too.</p>

<h3 class="center">FROM NAVIGATION LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<div class="indent">

<p>The board of local inspectors shall make an entry in the certificate
of inspection of every ocean and coastwise seagoing merchant vessel
of the United States propelled by machinery, and every ocean-going
vessel carrying passengers, the minimum number of licensed deck
officers required for her safe navigation according to the following
scale:</p>

<p>That no such vessel shall be navigated unless she shall have on
board and in her service one duly licensed master. (Mar. 3, 1913;
sec. 2.)</p>

<h4>Three watches.</h4>

<p>That every such vessel of one thousand gross tons and over,
propelled by machinery, shall have in her service and on board
three licensed mates, who shall stand in three watches while such
vessel is being navigated, unless such vessel is engaged in a run of
less than four hundred miles from the port of departure to the port
of final destination, then such vessel shall have two licensed mates;
and every vessel of two hundred gross tons and less than one thousand
gross tons, propelled by machinery, shall have two licensed mates.</p>

<p>That every such vessel of one hundred gross tons and under two
hundred gross tons, propelled by machinery, shall have on board
and in her service one licensed mate; but if such vessel is engaged
in a trade in which the time required to make the passage from the
port of departure to the port of destination exceeds twenty-four
hours, then such vessel shall have two licensed mates.</p>

<p>That nothing in this section shall be so construed as to prevent
local inspectors from increasing the number of licensed officers on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
any vessel subject to the inspection laws of the United States if,
in their judgment, such vessel is not sufficiently manned for her safe
navigation: <i>Provided</i>, That this section shall not apply to fishing or
whaling vessels, yachts, or motor boats as defined in the Act of June
ninth, nineteen hundred and ten.</p>

<h4>Rest before going on watch.</h4>

<p>It shall be unlawful for the master, owner, agent, or other person
having authority, to permit an officer of any vessel to take charge
of the deck watch of the vessel upon leaving or immediately after
leaving port, unless such officer shall have had at least six hours off
duty within the twelve hours immediately preceding the time of
sailing, and no licensed officer on any ocean or coastwise vessel shall
be required to do duty to exceed nine hours of any twenty-four
while in port, including the date of arrival, or more than twelve hours
of any twenty-four at sea, except in a case of emergency when life
or property is endangered. Any violation of this section shall subject
the person or persons guilty thereof to a penalty of one hundred
dollars. (Sec. 3.)</p>

</div>

<p><b>Master Liable.</b> The improper keeping of watch comes
clearly under the head of negligence, or even misconduct,
and the law governing this is of importance. The penalty,
when death results from such negligence, misconduct, etc.
is TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FINE or IMPRISONMENT
FOR TEN YEARS, <b>OR BOTH</b>.</p>

<p>The law is given below:</p>

<div class="indent">

<h4>Death from negligence, misconduct, etc.</h4>

<p>Every captain, engineer, pilot, or other person employed on any
steamboat or vessel, by whose misconduct, negligence, or inattention
to his duties on such vessel the life of any person is destroyed, and
every owner, charterer, inspector, or other public officer, through
whose fraud, neglect, connivance, misconduct, or violation of law
the life of any person is destroyed, shall be fined not more than ten
thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both:
<i>Provided</i>, That when the owner or charterer of any steamboat or
vessel shall be a corporation, any executive officer of such corporation,
for the time being actually charged with the control and management
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
of the operation, equipment, or navigation of such steamboat
or vessel, who has knowingly and willfully caused or allowed such
fraud, neglect, connivance, misconduct, or violation of law, by which
the life of any person is destroyed, shall be fined not more than ten
thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.
(Sec. 282; Repeals R. S., 5344, and act Mar. 3, 1905, sec. 5.)</p>

</div>

<p>Watch officers should also heed another matter, a section
of Rule V, of the Board of Supervising Inspectors, this
rule is also given:</p>

<div class="indent">

<h4>Only certain persons allowed in pilot house and on navigator's
bridge.</h4>

<p>17. Masters and pilots of steamers carrying passengers shall exclude
from the pilot houses and navigator's bridge of such steamers,
while under way, all persons not connected with the navigation of
such steamers, except officers of the Steamboat-Inspection Service,
Coast Guard, and engineer officers of the United States Army in
charge of the improvement of that particular waterway, when upon
business: <i>Provided</i>, That licensed officers of steamboats, persons
regularly engaged in learning the profession of pilot, officers of the
United States Navy, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and
Lighthouse Service, assistant engineers of the Engineer Department
of the United States Army connected with the improvement of that
particular waterway, and the engineer officers connected with the
construction and operation of the Panama Canal may be allowed
in the pilot house or upon the navigator's bridge upon the responsibility
of the officer in charge.</p>

<p>The master of every such passenger and ferry steamer shall keep
three printed copies of this section of Rule V posted in conspicuous
places on such steamer, one of which shall be kept posted in the pilot
house.</p>

<p>Such printed copies shall be furnished by the Department of Commerce
to local inspectors for distribution. (Sec. 4405, R. S.)</p>

</div>

<p><b>Relieving the Watch.</b> On well-conducted vessels no part
of the routine is so important, and so necessary of clear-cut
understanding, as the matter of turning over the watch.</p>

<p>On a steamer in which the writer had the good fortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
to serve—a liner in the Transatlantic service—this formality
was practiced with the utmost precision.</p>

<p>The officer in charge of the watch would keep facing
ahead, near the telegraph, if the weather was thick. He
would turn over the data of the watch rapidly and clearly;
the relieving officer having already read over and initialed
the Captain's order book.</p>

<div class="misc">

<ol class="n">
 <li>Special orders from the Captain.</li>
 <li>Position—how obtained—when.</li>
 <li>Vessels passed; in last hour, at least.</li>
 <li>Weather—fog if any; sea rising or falling.</li>
 <li>Wind, veering, or hauling.</li>
 <li>Distance made—by log—revolutions.</li>
 <li>Soundings taken—if any.</li>
 <li>Lights sighted, or expected; if in pilot waters.</li>
 <li>How vessel was steering—wild—good—etc.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p><b>THEN—being ready to turn over the watch:</b></p>

<p>"The course is N. 76 degrees east," says the Officer of
the Watch.</p>

<p>"N. 76 degrees, east," is the reply, and the moment these
words are spoken the relief is in charge, and steps next to
the telegraph.</p>

<p><b>An Incident at Eight Bells.</b> This simple ceremony of
turning the watch over took place one morning at eight
bells—it was a smoky channel morning, heavy weather had
been met with on the run eastward, and the train for London
was waiting at Southampton, for the first-class passengers
who expected to dine at the metropolis that night. It was
foggy, and the vessel was doing close to twenty knots; the
telegraphs at "stand by." Everything had been passed
over to the relief. The quartermasters and juniors had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
relieved each other, two watches were on the bridge at once,
in the cold wet mist. One crowd, still a trifle sleepy, but
filled with a sea breakfast, the other tired and wet.</p>

<p>Just as the course was being given, and half completed,
something leapt out of the gray fog:</p>

<p>Three "toots"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>
on the horn in the crow's nest, sounded
and a four-masted sailer shot up, as if a picture thrown on
the screen of fog ahead.</p>

<p>"<b>Hard Starb'd!</b>" the order snapped out on the tail of
the words of the course. The wet and draggled officer of
the watch had not yet received his reply—<b>he was still in
charge</b>.</p>

<p>His order came with the harsh jangle of the telegraph—he
was stopping the port engine—and we swept past an
iron four-masted ship, her crew clambering to the bulwarks,
her sails slatting in the breeze, as we got the first sound of
her horn.</p>

<p>The above is an instance where something happened at
a critical moment. But both officers were trained men, and
the man in charge knew he was still responsible, and acted
without a second of delay.</p>

<p><b>Responsibility.</b> Few men, aside from those who serve as
officers at sea, have the responsibility of life and property so
directly under them as the officers of the watch.</p>

<p>The young man who takes his first watch as officer in
charge—with the great vessel—her lives—and cargo, all
obedient to his order and dependent upon his skill and quickness
in the sudden emergency that may spring up at any
moment; that youngster is to be congratulated. Few men
are given the direct handling and responsibility for such
mighty forces.</p>

<p>He, in most cases, realizes this. Accidents are usually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
the outgrowth of carelessness, resulting from long watches
at sea <b>where nothing ever happens</b>.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the officer of the watch constantly
keep his edge. The old-fashioned system of "watch and
watch," that man- and soul-killing drill of an age of short-sighted
"economy," has come to be frowned upon by those
who have had to pay the bills resulting from accident and
loss.</p>

<p>The Officer of the watch should come to the bridge fresh
and in full vigor. His senses of sight and hearing should be
acute; he should be completely awake during the whole
four hours of his duty.</p>

<p>He should constantly keep in mind what he must do
under certain emergencies.</p>

<p>He should constantly be rehearsing disaster—with foresight
as his mentor.</p>

<p>He must have ingrained in his being the instinctive
knowledge of PORT and STARBOARD, and what they
mean. Not as <b>words, but as effects</b>.</p>

<p>He should be a part of the ship. The direction of her
head, or the action of her engines, should be as natural to
him as any movement of his own body.</p>

<p>This habit of mind enables an officer to act as quick as
he can think—to do the right thing without an instant of
hesitation.</p>

<p><b>Rules of the Road.</b> The rules of the road should also be
a part of his unconscious knowledge—particularly those rules
relating to the prevention of collision at sea.</p>

<p>Many watch officers—familiar with the rules of the Road
on the high seas, are lamentably lax when conning their
vessel through narrow waters; here is where a great percentage
of the accidents to vessels occur. Know the inland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
rules, the whistle signals; the proper side of the fairways to
take; the buoys and marks.</p>

<p><b>What to Look Out for.</b> The officer of the watch should
keep his eyes pretty close to the water ahead; even in the
sleepy times of peace. Look for patches of weed; and avoid
them. Look for submerged wreckage; floating mines—for
many years after the war—well whitened with bird droppings,
and almost invisible in the wake of the sun.</p>

<p>And at the present time no merchantman needs to be
warned to look out for periscopes, or what to do when he
sees one—and remember they are camouflaged too. Do not
be too quick to ram a periscope that is lying still. It may
be a mine.</p>

<p><b>Vessels without Lights.</b> Vessels in dangerous waters now
run without the usual lights—in fact with no lights at all.
This brings us to the question of redoubled vigilance of the
keenest and most wide-awake type of watch officer. As
vessels become more valuable, and more necessary—the
necessity for the best kind of conning is self evident. Yet,
due to our unfortunate lack of sea interest it is now necessary,
to let down the bars and send back to the sea men who lack
in the keenness and training that the situation demands, men
who are simply so because of our faulty lack of foresight in
the past.</p>

<p><b>The running without lights is sanctioned by the governments
at war, as a necessary war measure and fog signals
are omitted in war zones.</b></p>

<p><b>The Unwritten Rule.</b> Watch officers have long considered
an "unwritten rule" that has no doubt been acted
upon. Namely, if you see collision coming, "hit the other
fellow." This of course is to be taken for what it is worth
and should find no response in the mind of the young officer
who tramps the bridge on the night watch and works out
the problems of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
The law is very concise about the "Risk of collision"
and collision comes without much warning. The one thing
that is positive, is the duty to stand by, and this is incumbent
on both vessels.</p>

<p><b>Risk of Collision Rule.</b> Risk of collision can, when circumstances
permit, be ascertained by carefully watching
the compass bearing of an approaching vessel. If the bearing
does not appreciably change, such risk should be deemed
to exist.</p>

<p><b>Duty to Stay by.</b> In every case of collision between two
vessels it shall be the duty of the master or person in charge
of each vessel, if and so far as he can do so without serious
danger to his own vessel, crew, and passengers (if any), to
stay by the other vessel until he has ascertained that she
has no need of further assistance, and to render to the other
vessel, her master, crew, and passengers (if any), such assistance
as may be practicable and as may be necessary in order
to save them from any danger caused by the collision, and
also to give to the master or person in charge of the other
vessel the name of his own vessel and her port of registry,
or the port or place to which she belongs, and also the name
of the ports and places from which and to which she is
bound.</p>

<p>If he fails so to do, and no reasonable cause for such
failure is shown, the collision shall, in the absence of proof
to the contrary, be deemed to have been caused by his
wrongful act, neglect, or default.</p>

<p>Every master or person in charge of a United States
vessel who fails, without reasonable cause, to render such
assistance or give such information as aforesaid shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be liable to a
penalty of one thousand dollars, or imprisonment for a term
not exceeding two years; and for the above sum the vessel
shall be liable and may be seized and proceeded against by
process in any district court of the United States by any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
person; one-half such sum to be payable to the informer
and the other half to the United States.</p>

<p><b>Dangerous Conditions.</b> Fog, mist, bright moonlight, coal
black night, with phosphorescent sea; all are dangerous conditions
so far as visibility is concerned. From three to five
in the morning; at the tail of the mid watch, and for the
first hour of the morning watch, when vitality is low, and
the senses of man lag with the coming of the dawn; then is
the time that the officer of the watch should key himself
to a sense of complete responsibility—helped out by black
coffee if it can be had—and every steamer should provide
this at the change of watch, and oftener if need be.</p>

<p><b>Look Out.</b> Be alive to the changes of the weather.
Steamship officers are liable to lack in this respect. Watch
the stars, if out. Note the sudden snuffing out of stars
near the horizon—watch out for fog banks lying low ahead.</p>

<p>Look out for white water, squalls, get awnings in before
they are blown away—never leaving the bridge, of course,
unless the Master relieves.</p>

<p><b>Ice.</b> If in the dangerous latitudes look out for ice. Note
sudden changes in the temperature of air and sea. The sea
water should be taken every hour at least. Ice gives no
warning—sense it, and slow down before it is too late.
Remember the Titanic.</p>

<p>Watch the barometer changes—the clouds—the wind, and
its changes, whether veering, or hauling.</p>

<p><b>Important.</b> Know the sailing ship routes—study the
pilot charts—and always remember the possible speed and
condition of sail, whether on the wind, or free, of sailing
vessels that are liable to be met with in your vicinity.</p>

<p><b>Night Orders.</b> The night order book contains two sets
of orders:</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></div>

 <h3 class="center">THE STANDING ORDERS</h3>

<div class="indent bold">

<p>A. Before taking charge make yourself thoroughly familiar with the
position of the ship with reference to vessels in sight, any land or
shoals or rocks that may be near; with the general condition of the
weather, speed, revolutions, sail, if any is set, awnings, boats swung
out, running lights, and the orders of the Captain for the night.</p>

<p>B. Make no change in the course—unless instructed to do so by the
night orders, without obtaining the permission of the Captain—unless it
is necessary to avoid immediate danger. Then report promptly to the
Captain—by messenger or telephone.</p>

<p>C. Make no change in the speed, unless as directed by the night
orders, or to avoid collision.</p>

<p>D. Report promptly to the Captain all lights upon the shore;
discolored water; unusual weather conditions; and report all vessels
sighted and their nature, when this can be determined. (At night, it is
not usual to report every steamer passed.)</p>

<p>E. When in doubt about anything affecting the safety of the vessel,
call the Captain at once.</p>

<p>F. In the event of fire, or any kind of disturbance or accident,
call the Captain at once, and report same.</p>

<p>G. Man overboard; act at once, stop, reverse, release water lights
and ring buoys, call away quarter boat, and call Captain.</p>

<p>H. Keep lookouts posted after dark, or in fog. Comply with all the
regulations for preventing collisions at sea. Call Captain if it gets
thick; start fog signals at once.</p>

<p>I. Report all unusual changes in sea or weather to the Captain. If
engines stop, or slow down without orders from the bridge, call Captain
at once.</p>

<p>J. Take bearings on the course whenever suitable stars are
available. Call Captain at any unusual change in deviation, or
error.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
K. Get sights when favorable conditions present themselves. Report
all fixes to the Captain, on Officers' Report Blanks, show bearings,
and time (ship) and log readings.</p>

<p>L. All officers must read and sign these STANDING ORDERS, and must
read and sign the night order book at the beginning of their watch,
before taking over the course.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="center">THE NIGHT ORDERS</h3>

<p>The night orders are usually written up by the Master in the dog watch
and are signed by the officer coming on for the first night watch,
eight to midnight.</p>

<p>They may be amended and added to at any time. If the Master adds
anything to the orders he will relieve the officer of the watch, while
his added instructions are being read and initialed, if necessary.</p>

<p>The night orders are liable to instruct about:</p>

<div class="misc bold">

<ol class="n">
 <li>Changes in the course—when—how much—what course.</li>
 <li>Cautions as to lights and landfalls expected.</li>
 <li>Cautions as to vessels to be met.</li>
 <li>Cautions as to weather changes.</li>
 <li>Instructions as to calling of Captain, Chief Mate, etc.</li>
 <li>Instructions as to getting under way, calling officers, men, (when at anchor).</li>
 <li>Instructions as to navigation—sights—bearings.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p><b>The Deck.</b> Where the Chief Mate stands a bridge watch,
the officer of the watch is generally considered to be in
charge of the men on deck, though they may be engaged
at work under the boatswain—work laid out by the Chief
Mate. This, however, is largely a matter of organization.
If the vessel is small, the officer of the watch can keep an
eye on things from the bridge. If he needs assistance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
any kind he calls for it. He directs the taking in of awnings,
and sails, if carried, the turning of ventilators, the closing of
the cowls in case of rain.</p>

<p><b>Fire.</b> In the event of fire:</p>

<p>CALL THE CAPTAIN, if a junior officer, call the Chief
Mate also.</p>

<p>At the same time sound the fire alarms.</p>

<p>The usual fire drill then takes place.</p>

<p>The vessel is turned over to the Captain as soon as fire
is reported and the officer of the watch attends at the fire
or does as he is directed by the Captain. The Chief Engineer
should also be informed of the fire, and the engineer
on watch is advised of it by telephone or by voice tube.</p>

<p>The wireless operators are advised at once and await
the orders of the Captain, except in case of sudden disaster,
when they at once send out their calls for assistance.</p>

<p><b>Being Overtaken.</b> When your vessel is being overtaken,
set off flare-up and call Captain at once. On many slow
cargo steamers a lookout astern is almost as necessary as
a lookout ahead.</p>

<p><b>Running Lights.</b> In narrow waters have oil lamps trimmed
and ready for use, in case the electric lights give out. This
is very important.</p>

<p><b>In War Zone.</b> The standing of watches in the war zone
is subject to special precautions.</p>

<p>The following recommendations have been published by
the Supervising Inspector General:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p class="nodent">Recommendations.</p>

<p>Reliable information is to the effect that many or nearly all of the
lives that have been lost from vessels after attack has been due to the
fact that, in many instances, the boats have been launched while the
ship has had considerable way, either ahead or astern, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
engineers have been compelled to abandon the engine room while the
engines were still working.</p>

<p>It is suggested, therefore, that the bridge watch, or the master,
assure themselves, if possible, that the engines are at rest and the
way off the vessel before the boats are launched. It is also strongly
recommended that, due to the possibility of the boats on the weather
side of the ship not being available, the full lifeboat capacity on
cargo ships be carried on each side so that full capacity may be
available at all times.</p>

<p>It is strongly and earnestly recommended that on all vessels entering
the War Zone, or the dangerous areas, the passengers and crew be kept
fully prepared (so far as may be possible or the navigation of the
vessel permits), for speedy and immediate disembarking, or abandoning
ship in case of emergency, and that the crew be furnished with life
preservers of such character as to allow the free use of the arms in
rowing and boat launching. All should be warmly clad without
unnecessary or hindering incumbrance.</p>

<p>The requirements and suggestions herein set forth should be met
promptly and generously, and it is expected that all concerned will
cooperate in making better and safer conditions in the navigation of
dangerous areas. Local inspectors, however, will not unnecessarily
delay vessels from proceeding on their voyage to ports of the Allied
Governments if it is not possible to meet these requirements previous
to the appointed time of departure.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Zig-zag.</b> The great utility of zig-zagging is recognized.
The Zig-zag control apparatus, marketed by Captain Arthur
N. McGray of New York, has special advantages, and watch
officers should master its use.</p>

<p><b>Bearings.</b> Get bearings, <b>bow and beam</b>, <b>two point</b>, or
<b>cross</b>, at every opportunity. Get <b>vertical angles</b>, <b>horizontal
angles</b>, <b>tangents</b>, wherever possible. <b>Fix</b> the vessel as often
as you can.</p>

<p>If the vessel carried a three-armed protractor, get the horizontal
angles between any three objects that are visible, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
favorably situated with reference to the vessel, <b>and are
plotted on the chart</b>.</p>

<p><b>Lights.</b> See all light houses, and light ships, when you
expect to, or call the Captain.</p>

<p><b>Azimuths—Amplitudes.</b> Get azimuths and amplitudes
at every favorable opportunity and see the results carefully
entered in the deviation log, so the Captain can inspect
them.</p>

<p><b>Sights.</b> Get sights as often as possible on the watch.
With clear horizon at twilight, get stars east and west, and
north and south. Such a fix is often most important.
Check up all dead reckoning by observations.</p>

<p><b>Hydrographic Reports.</b> The report blanks furnished by
the Hydrographic Office should be carefully filled out and
forwarded. This duty is usually given to one of the junior
officers.</p>

<p><b>Pilot Charts.</b> The officer on watch can very profitably
occupy his mind in studying the pilot charts furnished by
the U. S. Hydrographic Office, they yield much useful data,
and are specially useful in warning of the existence of derelicts,
and their possible drift.</p>

<p><b>Derelicts.</b> Trace out all derelicts shown in your path
with their possible drift since last report. Always keep a
sharp lookout for them, whether on the pilot chart or not.</p>

<p><b>Bridge.</b> Many bridges are fitted with comfortable shelters
at the wings—others with elaborate enclosures. A
simple work desk should be provided, when only one officer
is on watch, so he can work out bearings, etc., while on the
bridge, facing ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
<b>Useful Desk.</b> The desk also serves as a handy table for
his sextant, or for a cup of hot coffee—cabin style.</p>

<p><b>Quartermasters.</b> Quartermasters are usually carried,
and they are under the immediate charge of the officer of
the watch. The care of the bridge, its neat and shipshape
appearance, reflects credit, or otherwise, on the watch officers.</p>

<p><b>Bridge Etiquette.</b> The etiquette of the bridge, in the
Merchant Service, especially on the large liners, is as formal
and stiff as that on any battleship. The heights of responsibility
are always on high tension. In the lesser trades,
on tramps and the like, officers are more lax, though they
should be no less vigilant.</p>

<p>Salutes are given and returned (on the liners) and uniform
is worn.</p>

<p>Relieving officer should be on bridge at least five minutes
before eight bells.</p>

<p><b>Commissions M. M.</b> The British Merchant Service is at
the present time strongly advocating commissions, by the
Government, for Merchant Marine Officers. With our Shipping
Board, and with the growing control by military and
naval authorities over merchantmen, some such plan might
be advisable for American Merchant Marine Officers, and
would undoubtedly help to elevate the standards, and bring
the naval and mercantile services into closer harmony.</p>

<p><b>Standard Uniform.</b> The British Merchant Service associations
are also agitating the question of some sort of
standard uniform for merchant service, officers and men.</p>

<p>This is a good idea, and should be adopted by Americans.
The writer, however, would not advise the adoption of the
naval blouse. This is the property of the U. S. Navy.
Merchant officers, if they adopt any sort of uniform, should
provide themselves with something having pockets, and a
roll collar, and less on the order of a princess gown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
<b>Conclusion.</b> The watch officers of a vessel should be
as familiar as possible with the handling qualities of their
vessel:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>Her turning circle.</p>

<p>Her quickest turn—usually both screws ahead.</p>

<p>Her shortest turn—inner screw slow astern and the way her head
scends, under all conditions.</p>

<p>See that the course is kept religiously—use small helm, be quick and
courteous. Keep a sharp lookout for signals when passing craft at
sea—Call Captain—and reply smartly.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="center">THE WATCH OFFICER—IN PORT</h3>

<p>While in port, merchant ships, except the larger liners,
do not indulge in the luxury of an officer of the watch, in
fact such a gentleman would be out of place with his telescope
under his arm, dodging drafts of cargo, and listening to the
repartee of the stevedores. Everything in its place, and as
common sense rules in the long run, the formalities of the
merchant service have settled down to the more simple
courtesies of life.</p>

<p>A quartermaster should be on gangway watch, cleanly
dressed, or in uniform, if it is worn, to see that only those
who have business on board are admitted to the ship. He
should salute the officers, who will return it.</p>

<p>On Sundays, and Holidays, when cargo is not being
worked, and when the ship is at rest, an officer should be
told off to stand day's duty. He should see that the vessel
is in shipshape order, falls neatly coiled, decks clean, Irish
pendants all removed, awnings hauled out taut, flags closely
mast headed and kept clear, and that everything is kept in
immaculate order about the gangway. He should not allow
loitering about the gangway.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
THE RULES OF THE ROAD</h2>

<h3 class="center">INTERNATIONAL RULES: I. ENACTING CLAUSE, SCOPE, AND PENALTY:</h3>

<p>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That the following
regulations for preventing collisions at sea shall be followed by all
public and private vessels of the United States upon the high seas
and in all waters connected therewith, navigable by seagoing vessels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article 30.</span> Nothing in these rules shall interfere with the operation
of a special rule, duly made by local authority, relative to the
navigation of any harbor, river, or inland waters.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></div>

<h4 class="center small">PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS</h4>

<p>In the following rules every steam vessel which is under sail
and not under steam is to be considered a sailing vessel, and every
vessel under steam, whether under sail or not, is to be considered a
steam vessel.</p>

<p>The words "steam vessel" shall include any vessel propelled
by machinery.</p>

<p>A vessel is "under way," within the meaning of these rules, when
she is not at anchor, or made fast to the shore, or aground.</p>

<h3 class="center">INTERNATIONAL RULES: II. LIGHTS, AND SO FORTH:</h3>

<p>The word "visible" in these rules when applied to lights shall
mean visible on a dark night with a clear atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article 1.</span> The rules concerning lights shall be complied with in
all weathers from sunset to sunrise, and during such time no other
lights which may be mistaken for the prescribed lights shall be
exhibited.</p>

<h4>Steam vessels—masthead light.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 2.</span> A steam vessel when under way shall carry—(<i>a</i>) On or in
front of the foremast, or if a vessel without a foremast, then in the
fore part of the vessel, at a height above the hull of not less than twenty
feet, and if the breadth of the vessel exceeds twenty feet, then at a
height above the hull not less than such breadth, so, however, that
the light need not be carried at a greater height above the hull than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
forty feet, a bright white light, so constructed as to show an unbroken
light over an arc of the horizon of twenty points of the compass,
so fixed as to throw the light ten points on each side of the
vessel, namely, from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on
either side, and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of
at least five miles.</p>

<h4>Steam vessels—side lights.</h4>

<p>(<i>b</i>) On the starboard side a green light so constructed as to show
an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of ten points of the
compass, so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to two points
abaft the beam on the starboard side, and of such a character as to
be visible at a distance of at least two miles.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) On the port side a red light so constructed as to show an unbroken
light over an arc of the horizon of ten points of the compass,
so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to two points abaft
the beam on the port side, and of such a character as to be visible at
a distance of at least two miles.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The said green and red side lights shall be fitted with inboard
screens projecting at least three feet forward from the light, so as to
prevent these lights from being seen across the bow.</p>

<h4>Steam vessels—range lights.</h4>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A steam vessel when under way may carry an additional
white light similar in construction to the light mentioned in subdivision
(<i>a</i>). These two lights shall be so placed in line with the keel
that one shall be at least fifteen feet higher than the other, and in such
a position with reference to each other that the lower light shall be
forward of the upper one. The vertical distance between these
lights shall be less than the horizontal distance.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></div>

<h4>Steam vessels when towing.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 3.</span> A steam vessel when towing another vessel shall, in addition
to her side lights, carry two bright white lights in a vertical line
one over the other, not less than six feet apart, and when towing more
than one vessel shall carry an additional bright white light six feet
above or below such lights, if the length of the tow measuring from
the stern of the towing vessel to the stern of the last vessel towed
exceeds six hundred feet. Each of these lights shall be of the same
construction and character, and shall be carried in the same position
as the white light mentioned in article two (<i>a</i>), excepting the additional
light, which may be carried at a height of not less than fourteen feet
above the hull.</p>

<p>Such steam vessel may carry a small white light abaft the funnel
or aftermast for the vessel towed to steer by, but such light shall not
be visible forward of the beam.</p>

<h4>Special lights.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 4.</span> (<i>a</i>) A vessel which from any accident is not under
command shall carry at the same height as a white light mentioned
in article two (<i>a</i>), where they can best be seen, and if a steam vessel
in lieu of that light two red lights, in a vertical line one over the other,
not less than six feet apart, and of such a character as to be visible all
around the horizon at a distance of at least two miles; and shall by
day carry in a vertical line one over the other, not less than six feet
apart, where they can best be seen, two black balls or shapes, each
two feet in diameter.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A vessel employed in laying or in picking up a telegraph
cable shall carry in the same position as the white light mentioned
in article two (<i>a</i>), and if a steam vessel in lieu of that light three
lights in a vertical line one over the other not less than six feet
apart. The highest and lowest of these lights shall be red, and the
middle light shall be white, and they shall be of such a character as
to be visible all around the horizon, at a distance of at least two miles.
By day she shall carry in a vertical line, one over the other, not less
than six feet apart, where they can best be seen, three shapes not
less than two feet in diameter, of which the highest and lowest shall
be globular in shape and red in color, and the middle one diamond
in shape and white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
(<i>c</i>) The vessels referred to in this article, when not making way
through the water, shall not carry the side lights, but when making
way shall carry them.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The lights and shapes required to be shown by this article
are to be taken by other vessels as signals that the vessel showing
them is not under command and can not therefore get out of the way.</p>

<p>These signals are not signals of vessels in distress and requiring
assistance. Such signals are contained in article thirty-one.</p>

<h4>Lights for sailing vessels and vessels in tow.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 5.</span> A sailing vessel under way and any vessel being towed
shall carry the same lights as are prescribed by article two for a steam
vessel under way, with the exception of the white lights mentioned
therein, which they shall never carry.</p>

<h4>Lights for small vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 6.</span> Whenever, as in the case of small vessels under way
during bad weather, the green and red side lights can not be fixed,
these lights shall be kept at hand, lighted and ready for use; and
shall, on the approach of or to other vessels, be exhibited on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
respective sides in sufficient time to prevent collision, in such manner
as to make them most visible, and so that the green light shall not
be seen on the port side nor the red light on the starboard side, nor,
if practicable, more than two points abaft the beam on their respective
sides. To make the use of these portable lights more certain and easy
the lanterns containing them shall each be painted outside with the
color of the light they respectively contain, and shall be provided with
proper screens.</p>

<h4>Lights for small steam and sail vessels and open boats.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 7.</span> Steam vessels of less than forty, and vessels under
oars or sails of less than twenty tons gross tonnage, respectively,
and rowing boats, when under way, shall not be required to carry
the lights mentioned in article two (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), and (<i>c</i>), but if they do
not carry them they shall be provided with the following lights:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> Steam vessels of less than forty tons shall carry—</p>

</div>

<div class="indent2">

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the fore part of the vessel, or on or in front of the funnel,
where it can best be seen, and at a height above the gunwale of not less
than nine feet, a bright white light constructed and fixed as prescribed
in article two (<i>a</i>), and of such a character as to be visible at
a distance of at least two miles.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Green and red side lights constructed and fixed as prescribed
in article two (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), and of such a character as to be visible at
a distance of at least one mile, or a combined lantern showing a green
light and a red light from right ahead to two points abaft the beam
on their respective sides. Such lanterns shall be carried not less
than three feet below the white light.</p>

</div>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>Second.</i> Small steamboats, such as are carried by seagoing vessels,
may carry the white light at a less height than nine feet above the
gunwale, but it shall be carried above the combined lantern mentioned
in subdivision one (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> Vessels under oars or sails of less than twenty tons shall
have ready at hand a lantern with a green glass on one side and a red
glass on the other, which, on the approach of or to other vessels,
shall be exhibited in sufficient time to prevent collision, so that the
green light shall not be seen on the port side nor the red light on the
starboard side.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> Rowing boats, whether under oars or sail, shall have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
ready at hand a lantern showing a white light which shall be temporarily
exhibited in sufficient time to prevent collision.</p>

<p>The vessels referred to in this article shall not be obliged to carry
the lights prescribed by article four (<i>a</i>) and article eleven, last paragraph.</p>

<h4>Lights for pilot vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 8.</span> Pilot vessels when engaged on their station on pilotage
duty shall not show the lights required for other vessels, but shall
carry a white light at the masthead, visible all around the horizon,
and shall also exhibit a flare-up light or flare-up lights at short
intervals, which shall never exceed fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>On the near approach of or to other vessels they shall have their
side lights lighted, ready for use, and shall flash or show them at
short intervals, to indicate the direction in which they are heading,
but the green light shall not be shown on the port side, nor the red
light on the starboard side.</p>

<p>A pilot vessel of such a class as to be obliged to go alongside
of a vessel to put a pilot on board may show the white light instead
of carrying it at the masthead, and may, instead of the colored lights
above mentioned, have at hand, ready for use, a lantern with green
glass on the one side and red glass on the other, to be used as prescribed
above.</p>

<p>Pilot vessels when not engaged on their station on pilotage duty
shall carry lights similar to those of other vessels of their tonnage.</p>

<p>A steam pilot vessel, when engaged on her station on pilotage
duty and in the waters of the United States, and not at anchor,
shall, in addition to the lights required for all pilot boats, carry at
a distance of eight feet below her white masthead light a red light,
visible all around the horizon and of such a character as to be visible
on a dark night with a clear atmosphere at a distance of at least
two miles, and also the colored side lights required to be carried by
vessels when under way.</p>

<p>When engaged on her station on pilotage duty and in waters of
the United States, and at anchor, she shall carry in addition to the
lights required for all pilot boats the red light above mentioned, but
not the colored side lights. When not engaged on her station on
pilotage duty, she shall carry the same lights as other steam vessels.</p>

when not required by this article to carry or show the lights hereinafter
specified, shall carry or show the lights prescribed for vessels of their
tonnage under way.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Open boats, by which it is to be understood boats not protected
from the entry of sea water by means of a continuous deck, when
engaged in any fishing at night, with outlying tackle extending not
more than one hundred and fifty feet horizontally from the boat
into the seaway, shall carry one all-round white light.</p>

<p>Open boats, when fishing at night, with outlying tackle extending
more than one hundred and fifty feet horizontally from the boat
into the seaway, shall carry one all-round white light, and in addition,
on approaching or being approached by other vessels, shall show a
second white light at least three feet below the first light and at a
horizontal distance of at least five feet away from it in the
direction in which the outlying tackle is attached.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Vessels and boats, except open boats as defined in subdivision
(<i>a</i>), when fishing with drift nets, shall, so long as the nets
are wholly or partly in the water, carry two white lights where they
can best be seen. Such lights shall be placed so that the vertical
distance between them shall be not less than six feet and not more
than fifteen feet, and so that the horizontal distance between them,
measured in a line with the keel, shall be not less than five feet and
not more than ten feet. The lower of these two lights shall be in the
direction of the nets, and both of them shall be of such a character
as to show all around the horizon, and to be visible at a distance of

<h3 class="center">INTERNATIONAL RULES: III. SOUND SIGNALS FOR FOG, AND SO FORTH</h3>

<h4>Preliminary.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 15.</span> All signals prescribed by this article for vessels under
way shall be given:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> By "steam vessels" on the whistle or siren.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> By "sailing vessels" and "vessels towed" on the fog
horn.</p>

</div>

<p>The words "prolonged blast" used in this article shall mean a
blast of from four to six seconds duration.</p>

<p>A steam vessel shall be provided with an efficient whistle or siren,
sounded by steam or by some substitute for steam, so placed that the
sound may not be intercepted by any obstruction, and with an
efficient fog horn, to be sounded by mechanical means, and also with
an efficient bell. In all cases where the rules require a bell to be
used a drum may be substituted on board Turkish vessels, or a gong
where such articles are used on board small seagoing vessels. A
sailing vessel of twenty tons gross tonnage or upward shall be provided
with a similar fog horn and bell.</p>

<p>In a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain storms, whether by day
or night, the signals described in this article shall be used as follows,
namely:</p>

<div class="indent">

<h4>Steam vessel under way.</h4>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A steam vessel having way upon her shall sound, at intervals
of not more than two minutes, a prolonged blast.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A steam vessel under way, but stopped, and having no way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
upon her, shall sound, at intervals of not more than two minutes,
two prolonged blasts, with an interval of about one second between.</p>

<h4>Sail vessel under way.</h4>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A sailing vessel under way shall sound, at intervals of not
more than one minute, when on the starboard tack, one blast; when
on the port tack, two blasts in succession, and when with the wind
abaft the beam, three blasts in succession.</p>

<h4>Vessels at anchor or not under way.</h4>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A vessel when at anchor shall, at intervals of not more than
one minute, ring the bell rapidly for about five seconds.</p>

<h4>Vessels towing or towed.</h4>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A vessel when towing, a vessel employed in laying or in picking
up a telegraph cable, and a vessel under way, which is unable
to get out of the way of an approaching vessel through being not
under command, or unable to maneuver as required by the rules,
shall, instead of the signals prescribed in subdivisions (<i>a</i>) and (<i>c</i>)
of this article, at intervals of not more than two minutes, sound three
blasts in succession, namely: One prolonged blast followed by two
short blasts. A vessel towed may give this signal and she shall not
give any other.</p>

</div>

<h4>Small sailing vessels and boats.</h4>

<p>Sailing vessels and boats of less than twenty tons gross tonnage
shall not be obliged to give the above-mentioned signals, but, if
they do not, they shall make some other efficient sound signal at
intervals of not more than one minute.</p>

<h4>Speed in fog.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 16.</span> Every vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy
rain storms, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing
circumstances and conditions.</p>

<p>A steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog
signal of a vessel the position of which is not ascertained shall, so far
as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then
navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></div>

<h3 class="center">INTERNATIONAL RULES: IV. STEERING AND SAILING RULES</h3>

<h4>Preliminary.</h4>

<p>Risk of collision can, when circumstances permit, be ascertained
by carefully watching the compass bearing of an approaching vessel.
If the bearing does not appreciably change, such risk should be deemed
to exist.</p>

<h4>Sailing vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 17.</span> When two sailing vessels are approaching one another,
so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way
of the other, as follows, namely:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>(<i>a</i>) A vessel which is running free shall keep out of the way of a
vessel which is closehauled.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A vessel which is closehauled on the port tack shall keep
out of the way of a vessel which is closehauled on the starboard tack.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) When both are running free, with the wind on different sides,
the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the
way of the other.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) When both are running free, with the wind on the same side,
the vessel which is to the windward shall keep out of the way of the
vessel which is to the leeward.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A vessel which has the wind aft shall keep out of the way of
the other vessel.</p>

</div>

<h4>Steam vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 18.</span> When two steam vessels are meeting end on, or nearly
end on, so as to involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to
starboard, so that each may pass on the port side of the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
This article only applies to cases where vessels are meeting end
on, or early end on, in such a manner as to involve risk of collision,
and does not apply to two vessels which must, if both keep on their
respective courses, pass clear of each other.</p>

<p>The only cases to which it does apply are when each of the two
vessels is end on, or nearly end on to the other; in other words, to
cases in which, by day, each vessel sees the masts of the other in a
line, or nearly in a line, with her own; and by night, to cases in which
each vessel is in such a position as to see both the side lights of the
other.</p>

<p>It does not apply by day to cases in which a vessel sees another
ahead crossing her own course; or by night, to cases where the red
light of one vessel is opposed to the red light of the other, or where
the green light of one vessel is opposed to the green light of the other,
or where a red light without a green light, or a green light without a
red light, is seen ahead, or where both green and red lights are seen
anywhere but ahead.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></div>

<h4>Two steam vessels crossing.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 19.</span> When two steam vessels are crossing, so as to involve
risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard
side shall keep out of the way of the other.</p>

<h4>Steam vessel shall keep out of the way of sailing vessel.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 20.</span> When a steam vessel and a sailing vessel are proceeding
in such directions as to involve risk of collision, the steam vessel
shall keep out of the way of the sailing vessel.</p>

<h4>Course and speed.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 21.</span> Where, by any of these rules, one of two vessels is to
keep out of the way the other shall keep her course and speed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—When, in consequence of thick weather or other causes,
such vessel finds herself so close that collision can not be avoided by
the action of the giving-way vessel alone, she also shall take such
action as will best aid to avert collision. [See articles twenty-seven
and twenty-nine.]</p>

<h4>Crossing ahead.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 22.</span> Every vessel which is directed by these rules to keep
out of the way of another vessel shall, if the circumstances of the
case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other.</p>

<h4>Steam vessel shall slacken speed or stop.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 23.</span> Every steam vessel which is directed by these rules to
keep out of the way of another vessel shall, on approaching her, if
necessary, slacken her speed or stop or reverse.</p>

<h4>Overtaking vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 24.</span> Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules every
vessel, overtaking any other, shall keep out of the way of the overtaken
vessel.</p>

<p>Every vessel coming up with another vessel from any direction
more than two points abaft her beam, that is, in such a position,
with reference to the vessel which she is overtaking that at night
she would be unable to see either of that vessel's side lights, shall
be deemed to be an overtaking vessel; and no subsequent alteration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
of the bearing between the two vessels shall make the overtaking
vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these rules, or relieve
her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is
finally past and clear.</p>

<p>As by day the overtaking vessel can not always know with certainty
whether she is forward of or abaft this direction from the
other vessel she should, if in doubt, assume that she is an overtaking
vessel and keep out of the way.</p>

<h4>Narrow channels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 25.</span> In narrow channels every steam vessel shall, when it is
safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel
which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.</p>

<h4>Right of way of fishing vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 26.</span> Sailing vessels under way shall keep out of the way of
sailing vessels or boats fishing with nets, or lines, or trawls. This
rule shall not give to any vessel or boat engaged in fishing the right
of obstructing a fairway used by vessels other than fishing vessels
or boats.</p>

<h4>General prudential rule.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 27.</span> In obeying and construing these rules due regard shall
be had to all dangers of navigation and collision, and to any special
circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules
necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.</p>

<h4>Sound signals for passing steamers.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 28.</span> The words "short blast" used in this article shall
mean a blast of about one second's duration.</p>

<p>When vessels are in sight of one another, a steam vessel under
way, in taking any course authorized or required by these rules, shall
indicate that course by the following signals on her whistle or siren,
namely:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>One short blast to mean, "I am directing my course to starboard."</p>

<p>Two short blasts to mean, "I am directing my course to port."</p>

<p>Three short blasts to mean, "My engines are going at full speed
astern."</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></div>

<h4>Precaution.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 29.</span> Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the
owner or master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any
neglect to carry lights or signals, or of any neglect to keep a proper
lookout, or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required
by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances
of the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 30.</span> Nothing in these rules shall interfere with the operation
of a special rule, duly made by local authority, relative to the navigation
of any harbor, river, or inland waters.</p>

<h4>Distress signals.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 31.</span> When a vessel is in distress and requires assistance from
other vessels or from the shore the following shall be the signals to
be used or displayed by her, either together or separately, namely:</p>

<p>At night—</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> A gun or other explosive signal fired at intervals of about
a minute.</p>

<h4 class="center small">PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS</h4>

<p>In the following rules every steam vessel which is under sail and
not under steam is to be considered a sailing vessel, and every vessel
under steam, whether under sail or not, is to be considered a steam
vessel.</p>

<p>The words "steam vessel" shall include any vessel propelled by

<p>A vessel is "under way," within the meaning of these rules, when
she is not at anchor, or made fast to the shore, or aground.</p>

<h3 class="center">INLAND RULES: II. LIGHTS AND SO FORTH</h3>

<p>The word "visible" in these rules, when applied to lights, shall
mean visible on a dark night with a clear atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article 1.</span> The rules concerning lights shall be complied with in
all weathers from sunset to sunrise, and during such time no other
lights which may be mistaken for the prescribed lights shall be
exhibited.</p>

<h4>Steam vessels—masthead light.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 2.</span> A steam vessel when under way shall carry—(<i>a</i>) On or
in the front of the foremast, or if a vessel without a foremast, then
in the fore part of the vessel, a bright white light so constructed as
to show an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of twenty points
of the compass, so fixed as to throw the light ten points on each side
of the vessel, namely, from right ahead to two points abaft the beam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
on either side, and of such a character as to be visible at a distance
of at least five miles.</p>

<h4>Steam vessels—side lights.</h4>

<p>(<i>b</i>) On the starboard side a green light so constructed as to show
an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of ten points of the compass,
so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to two points
abaft the beam on the starboard side, and of such a character as to be
visible at a distance of at least two miles.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) On the port side a red light so constructed as to show an
unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of ten points of the compass,
so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to two points abaft the
beam on the port side, and of such a character as to be visible at a
distance of at least two miles.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The said green and red side lights shall be fitted with inboard
screens projecting at least three feet forward from the light, so as to
prevent these lights from being seen across the bow.</p>

<h4>Steam vessels—range lights.</h4>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A seagoing steam vessel when under way may carry an additional
white light similar in construction to the light mentioned in
subdivision (<i>a</i>). These two lights shall be so placed in line with the
keel that one shall be at least fifteen feet higher than the other, and
in such a position with reference to each other that the lower light
shall be forward of the upper one. The vertical distance between
these lights shall be less than the horizontal distance.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) All steam vessels (except seagoing vessels and ferryboats),
shall carry in addition to green and red lights required by article two
(<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), and screens as required by article two (<i>d</i>), a central range of
two white lights; the after light being carried at an elevation at least
fifteen feet above the light at the head of the vessel. The headlight
shall be so constructed as to show an unbroken light through twenty
points of the compass, namely, from right ahead to two points abaft
the beam on either side of the vessel, and the after light so as to show
all around the horizon.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></div>

<h4>Steam vessels when towing.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 3.</span> A steam vessel when towing another vessel shall, in
addition to her side lights, carry two bright white lights in a vertical
line one over the other, not less than three feet apart, and when towing
more than one vessel shall carry an additional bright white light three
feet above or below such lights, if the length of the tow measuring
from the stern of the towing vessel to the stern of the last vessel towed
exceeds six hundred feet. Each of these lights shall be of the same
construction and character, and shall be carried in the same position
as the white light mentioned in article two (<i>a</i>) or the after range light
mentioned in article two (<i>f</i>).</p>

<p>Such steam vessel may carry a small white light abaft the funnel
or aftermast for the vessel towed to steer by, but such light shall not
be visible forward of the beam.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></div>

<h4>Lights for sailing vessels and vessels in tow.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 5.</span> A sailing vessel under way or being towed shall carry the
same lights as are prescribed by article two for a steam vessel under
way, with the exception of the white lights mentioned therein, which
they shall never carry.</p>

<h4>Lights for ferryboats, barges, and canal boats in tow.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> That the supervising inspectors of steam vessels and the
Supervising Inspector-General shall establish such rules to be observed
by steam vessels in passing each other and as to the lights to be carried
by ferryboats and by barges and canal boats when in tow of
steam vessels (and as to the lights and day signals to be carried by
vessels, dredges of all types, and vessels working on wrecks by [or]
other obstruction to navigation or moored for submarine operations,
or made fast to a sunken object which may drift with the tide or be
towed) not inconsistent with the provisions of this act, as they from
time to time may deem necessary for safety, which rules when approved
by the Secretary of Commerce are hereby declared special
rules duly made by local authority, as provided for in article thirty
of chapter eight hundred and two of the laws of eighteen hundred
and ninety. Two printed copies of such rules shall be furnished to
such ferryboats (barges, dredges, canal boats, vessels working on
wrecks) and steam vessels, which rules shall be kept posted up in
conspicuous places in such vessels (barges, dredges, and boats).</p>

<h4>Lights for small vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 6.</span> Whenever, as in the case of vessels of less than ten gross
tons under way during bad weather, the green and red side lights
can not be fixed, these lights shall be kept at hand, lighted and ready
for use; and shall, on the approach of or to other vessels, be exhibited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
on their respective sides in sufficient time to prevent collision, in
such manner as to make them most visible, and so that the green
light shall not be seen on the port side nor the red light on the starboard
side, nor, if practicable, more than two points abaft the beam
on their respective sides. To make the use of these portable lights
more certain and easy the lanterns containing them shall each be
painted outside with the color of the light they respectively contain,
and shall be provided with proper screens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 7.</span> Rowing boats, whether under oars or sail, shall have
ready at hand a lantern showing a white light which shall be temporarily
exhibited in sufficient time to prevent collision.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></div>

<h4>Lights for pilot vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 8.</span> Pilot vessels when engaged on their stations on pilotage
duty shall not show the lights required for other vessels, but shall
carry a white light at the masthead, visible all around the horizon,
and shall also exhibit a flare-up light or flare-up lights at short intervals,
which shall never exceed fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>On the near approach of or to other vessels they shall have their
side lights lighted, ready for use, and shall flash or show them at
short intervals, to indicate the direction in which they are heading,
but the green light shall not be shown on the port side nor the red
light on the starboard side.</p>

<p>A pilot vessel of such a class as to be obliged to go alongside of a
vessel to put a pilot on board may show the white light instead of
carrying it at the masthead, and may, instead of the colored lights
above mentioned, have at hand, ready for use, a lantern with a green
glass on the one side and a red glass on the other, to be used as prescribed
above.</p>

<p>Pilot vessels, when not engaged on their station on pilotage duty,
shall carry lights similar to those of other vessels of their tonnage.</p>

<p>A steam pilot vessel, when engaged on her station on pilotage
duty and in waters of the United States, and not at anchor, shall, in
addition to the lights required for all pilot boats, carry at a distance
of eight feet below her white masthead light a red light, visible all
around the horizon and of such a character as to be visible on a dark
night with a clear atmosphere at a distance of at least two miles,
and also the colored side lights required to be carried by vessels when
under way.</p>

<p>When engaged on her station on pilotage duty and in waters of
the United States, and at anchor, she shall carry in addition to the
lights required for all pilot boats the red light above mentioned,
but not the colored side lights. When not engaged on her station
on pilotage duty, she shall carry the same lights as other steam vessels.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></div>

<h4>Lights, etc., of fishing vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 9.</span> (<i>a</i>) Fishing vessels of less than ten gross tons, when
under way and when not having their nets, trawls, dredges, or lines
in the water, shall not be obliged to carry the colored side lights;
but every such vessel shall, in lieu thereof, have ready at hand a
lantern with a green glass on one side and a red glass on the other side,
and on approaching to or being approached by another vessel such
lantern shall be exhibited in sufficient time to prevent collision, so
that the green light shall not be seen on the port side nor the red light
on the starboard side.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) All fishing vessels and fishing boats of ten gross tons or upward,
when under way and when not having their nets, trawls,
dredges, or lines in the water, shall carry and show the same lights
as other vessels under way.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) All vessels, when trawling, dredging, or fishing with any kind
of drag nets or lines, shall exhibit, from some part of the vessel where
they can be best seen, two lights. One of these lights shall be red
and the other shall be white. The red light shall be above the white
light, and shall be at a vertical distance from it of not less than six
feet and not more than twelve feet; and the horizontal distance between
them, if any, shall not be more than ten feet. These two
lights shall be of such a character and contained in lanterns of such
construction as to be visible all round the horizon, the white light a
distance of not less than three miles and the red light of not less than
two miles.</p>

<h4>Lights for rafts or other craft not provided for.</h4>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Rafts, or other water craft not herein provided for, navigating
by hand power, horse power, or by the current of the river, shall
carry one or more good white lights, which shall be placed in such
manner as shall be prescribed by the Board of Supervising Inspectors
of Steam Vessels.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></div>

<h4>Lights for an overtaken vessel.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 10.</span> A vessel which is being overtaken by another, except
a steam vessel with an after range light showing all around the horizon,
shall show from her stern to such last-mentioned vessel a white light
or a flare-up light.</p>

<h4>Anchor lights.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 11.</span> A vessel under one hundred and fifty feet in length
when at anchor shall carry forward, where it can best be seen, but at
a height not exceeding twenty feet above the hull, a white light, in a
lantern so constructed as to show a clear, uniform, and unbroken light
visible all around the horizon at a distance of at least one mile.</p>

<p>A vessel of one hundred and fifty feet or upwards in length when
at anchor shall carry in the forward part of the vessel, at a height of
not less than twenty and not exceeding forty feet above the hull,
one such light, and at or near the stern of the vessel, and at such a
height that it shall be not less than fifteen feet lower than the forward
light, another such light.</p>

<p>The length of a vessel shall be deemed to be the length appearing
in her certificate of registry.</p>

<h4>Special Signals.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 12.</span> Every vessel may, if necessary, in order to attract
attention, in addition to the lights which she is by these rules required
to carry, show a flare-up light or use any detonating signal that can
not be mistaken for a distress signal.</p>

<h4>Naval lights and recognition signals.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 13.</span> Nothing in these rules shall interfere with the operation
of any special rules made by the Government of any nation with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
respect to additional station and signal lights for two or more ships
of war or for vessels sailing under convoy, or with the exhibition of
recognition signals adopted by shipowners, which have been authorized
by their respective Governments, and duly registered and published.</p>

<h4>Steam vessel under sail by day.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 14.</span> A steam vessel proceeding under sail only, but having
her funnel up, may carry in daytime, forward, where it can best be
seen, one black ball or shape two feet in diameter.</p>

<h3 class="center">INLAND RULES: III. SOUND SIGNALS FOR FOG, AND SO FORTH</h3>

<h4>Preliminary.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 15.</span> All signals prescribed by this article for vessels under
way shall be given:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>1. By "steam vessels" on the whistle or siren.</p>

<p>2. By "sailing vessels" and "vessels towed" on the fog horn.</p>

</div>

<p>The words "prolonged blast" used in this article shall mean a
blast of from four to six seconds duration.</p>

<p>A steam vessel shall be provided with an efficient whistle or siren,
sounded by steam or by some substitute for steam, so placed that the
sound may not be intercepted by any obstruction, and with an efficient
fog horn; also with an efficient bell. A sailing vessel of twenty
tons gross tonnage or upward shall be provided with a similar fog
horn and bell.</p>

<p>In fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain storms, whether by day
or night, the signals described in this article shall be used as follows,
namely:</p>

<div class="indent">

<h4>Steam vessel under way.</h4>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A steam vessel under way shall sound, at intervals of not more
than one minute, a prolonged blast.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></div>

<h4>Sail vessel under way.</h4>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A sailing vessel under way shall sound, at intervals of not more
than one minute, when on the starboard tack, one blast; when on
the port tack, two blasts in succession, and when with the wind
abaft the beam, three blasts in succession.</p>

<h4>Vessels at anchor or not under way.</h4>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A vessel when at anchor shall, at intervals of not more than
one minute, ring the bell rapidly for about five seconds.</p>

<h4>Vessels towing or towed.</h4>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A steam vessel when towing, shall, instead of the signals prescribed
in subdivision (<i>a</i>) of this article, at intervals of not more
than one minute, sound three blasts in succession, namely, one prolonged
blast followed by two short blasts. A vessel towed may give
this signal and she shall not give any other.</p>

<h4>Rafts, or other craft not provided for.</h4>

<p>(<i>f</i>) All rafts or other water craft, not herein provided for, navigating
by hand power, horse power, or by the current of the river,
shall sound a blast of the fog horn, or equivalent signal, at intervals
of not more than one minute.</p>

</div>

<h4>Speed in fog.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 16.</span> Every vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy
rain storms, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the
existing circumstances and conditions.</p>

<p>A steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog
signal of a vessel the position of which is not ascertained shall, so far
as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then
navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></div>

<h3 class="center">INLAND RULES: IV. STEERING AND SAILING RULES</h3>

<h4>Preliminary.</h4>

<p>Risk of collision can, when circumstances permit, be ascertained
by carefully watching the compass bearing of an approaching vessel.
If the bearing does not appreciably change, such risk should be
deemed to exist.</p>

<h4>Sailing vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 17.</span> When two sailing vessels are approaching one another,
so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way
of the other as follows, namely:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>(<i>a</i>) A vessel which is running free shall keep out of the way of a
vessel which is closehauled.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A vessel which is closehauled on the port tack shall keep out
of the way of a vessel which is closehauled on the starboard tack.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) When both are running free, with the wind on different sides,
the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the
way of the other.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) When both are running free, with the wind on the same side,
the vessel which is to the windward shall keep out of the way of the
vessel which is to the leeward.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A vessel which has the wind aft shall keep out of the way of
the other vessel.</p>

</div>

<h4>Steam vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 18. Rule I.</span> When steam vessels are approaching each
other head and head, that is, end on, or nearly so, it shall be the duty
of each to pass on the port side of the other; and either vessel shall
give, as a signal of her intention, one short and distinct blast of her
whistle, which the other vessel shall answer promptly by a similar
blast of her whistle, and thereupon such vessels shall pass on the port
side of each other. But if the courses of such vessels are so far on the
starboard of each other as not to be considered as meeting head and
head, either vessel shall immediately give two short and distinct
blasts of her whistle, which the other vessel shall answer promptly
by two similar blasts of her whistle, and they shall pass on the starboard
side of each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
The foregoing only applies to cases where vessels are meeting
end on, or nearly end on, in such a manner as to involve risk of collision;
in other words, to cases in which, by day, each vessel sees the
masts of the other in a line, or nearly in a line, with her own, and by
night to cases in which each vessel is in such a position as to see both
the side lights of the other.</p>

<p>It does not apply by day to cases in which a vessel sees another
ahead crossing her own course, or by night to cases where the red
light of one vessel is opposed to the red light of the other, or where the
green light of one vessel is opposed to the green light of the other,
or where a red light without a green light or a green light without a
red light, is seen ahead, or where both green and red lights are seen
anywhere but ahead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule III.</span> If, when steam vessels are approaching each other,
either vessel fails to understand the course or intention of the other,
from any cause, the vessel so in doubt shall immediately signify the
same by giving several short and rapid blasts, not less than four, of
the steam whistle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule V.</span> Whenever a steam vessel is nearing a short bend or
curve in the channel, where, from the height of the banks or other
cause, a steam vessel approaching from the opposite direction can
not be seen for a distance of half a mile, such steam vessel, when she
shall have arrived within half a mile of such curve or bend, shall give
a signal by one long blast of the steam whistle, which signal shall be
answered by a similar blast given by any approaching steam vessel
that may be within hearing. Should such signal be so answered by a
steam vessel upon the farther side of such bend, then the usual signals
for meeting and passing shall immediately be given and answered;
but, if the first alarm signal of such vessel be not answered,
she is to consider the channel clear and govern herself accordingly.</p>

<p>When steam vessels are moved from their docks or berths, and
other boats are liable to pass from any direction toward them, they
shall give the same signal as in the case of vessels meeting at a bend,
but immediately after clearing the berths so as to be fully in sight they
shall be governed by the steering and sailing rules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Rule VIII.</span> When steam vessels are running in the same direction,
and the vessel which is astern shall desire to pass on the right
or starboard hand of the vessel ahead, she shall give one short blast
of the steam whistle, as a signal of such desire, and if the vessel ahead
answers with one blast, she shall put her helm to port; or if she shall
desire to pass on the left or port side of the vessel ahead, she shall give
two short blasts of the steam whistle as a signal of such desire, and if
the vessel ahead answers with two blasts, shall put her helm to starboard;
or if the vessel ahead does not think it safe for the vessel astern
to attempt to pass at that point, she shall immediately signify the
same by giving several short and rapid blasts of the steam whistle,
not less than four, and under no circumstances shall the vessel astern
attempt to pass the vessel ahead until such time as they have reached
a point where it can be safely done, when said vessel ahead shall signify
her willingness by blowing the proper signals. The vessel ahead
shall in no case attempt to cross the bow or crowd upon the course of
the passing vessel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule IX.</span> The whistle signals provided in the rules under this
article, for steam vessels meeting, passing, or overtaking, are never
to be used except when steamers are in sight of each other, and the
course and position of each can be determined in the daytime by a
sight of the vessel itself, or by night by seeing its signal lights. In
fog, mist, falling snow or heavy rain storms, when vessels can not see
each other, fog signals only must be given.</p>

<h4>Supplementary regulations.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> That the supervising inspectors of steam-vessels and the
Supervising Inspector-General shall establish such rules to be observed
by steam vessels in passing each other and as to the lights to
be carried by ferryboats and by barges and canal boats when in tow
of steam vessels, not inconsistent with the provisions of this act, as
they from time to time may deem necessary for safety, which rules
when approved by the Secretary of Commerce are hereby declared
special rules duly made by local authority, as provided for in article
thirty of chapter eight hundred and two of the laws of eighteen
hundred and ninety. Two printed copies of such rules shall be furnished
to such ferryboats and steam vessels, which rules shall be kept
posted up in conspicuous places in such vessels.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></div>

<h4>Two steam vessels crossing.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 19.</span> When two steam vessels are crossing, so as to involve
risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard
side shall keep out of the way of the other.</p>

<h4>Steam vessel shall keep out of the way of sailing vessel.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 20.</span> When a steam vessel and a sailing vessel are proceeding
in such directions as to involve risk of collision, the steam vessel
shall keep out of the way of the sailing vessel.</p>

<h4>Course and speed.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 21.</span> Where, by any of these rules, one of the two vessels
is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed.
[See articles twenty-seven and twenty-nine.]</p>

<h4>Crossing ahead.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 22.</span> Every vessel which is directed by these rules to keep
out of the way of another vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case
admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other.</p>

<h4>Steam vessel shall slacken speed or stop.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 23.</span> Every steam vessel which is directed by these rules to
keep out of the way of another vessel shall, on approaching her, if
necessary, slacken her speed or stop or reverse.</p>

<h4>Overtaking vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 24.</span> Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules
every vessel, overtaking any other, shall keep out of the way of the
overtaken vessel.</p>

<p>Every vessel coming up with another vessel from any direction
more than two points abaft her beam, that is, in such a position, with
reference to the vessel which she is overtaking that at night she
would be unable to see either of that vessel's side lights, shall be
deemed to be an overtaking vessel; and no subsequent alteration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
the bearing between the two vessels shall make the overtaking vessel
a crossing vessel within the meaning of these rules, or relieve her of
the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally
past and clear.</p>

<p>As by day the overtaking vessel can not always know with certainty
whether she is forward of or abaft this direction from the other
vessel she should, if in doubt, assume that she is an overtaking vessel
and keep out of the way.</p>

<h4>Narrow channels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 25.</span> In narrow channels every steam vessel shall, when it is
safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel
which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.</p>

<h4>Right of way of fishing vessels.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 26.</span> Sailing vessels under way shall keep out of the way of
sailing vessels or boats fishing with nets, or lines, or trawls. This
rule shall not give to any vessel or boat engaged in fishing the right
of obstructing a fairway used by vessels other than fishing vessels or
boats.</p>

<h4>General prudential rule.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 27.</span> In obeying and construing these rules due regard shall
be had to all dangers of navigation and collision, and to any special
circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules
necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.</p>

<h4>Sound signals for passing steamers.</h4>

<p>[See article eighteen.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 28.</span> When vessels are in sight of one another a steam vessel
under way whose engines are going at full speed astern shall indicate
that fact by three short blasts on the whistle.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></div>

<h4>Precaution.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 29.</span> Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel, or
the owner or master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any
neglect to carry lights or signals, or of any neglect to keep a proper
lookout, or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required
by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of
the case.</p>

<h4>Lights on United States naval vessels and revenue cutters.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 30.</span> The exhibition of any light on board of a vessel of war
of the United States or a Coast Guard cutter may be suspended
whenever, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Navy, the commander-in-chief
of a squadron, or the commander of a vessel acting
singly, the special character of the service may require it.</p>

<h4>Distress signals.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 31.</span> When a vessel is in distress and requires assistance
from other vessels or from the shore the following shall be the signals
to be used or displayed by her, either together or separately, namely:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
THE QUARTERMASTERS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> many years the quartermasters—situated somewhere
between the deck hand (A.B.) and the licensed officer—have
been the slim loophole through which a few American
boys have slipped into the merchant service of their country.</p>

<p>The duties of the quartermasters have become fairly
standard, and besides steering in two, and sometimes four
hour shifts, the latter a practice that should be stopped by
law, the quartermasters have had to do about as follows:</p>

<div class="indent bold">

<p>Care of the bridge.</p>

<p>Care of all signal equipment—flags—rockets—lights—etc.</p>

<p>Care of navigational gear, such as sounding machines, log lines and
 indicators; leads, etc.</p>

<p>Heaving the lead (blue pigeon) and working the sounding machine
 under an officer.</p>

<p>In port, the quartermasters have had to stand gangway watches, and
 watches in the holds while stowing or discharging cargo.</p>

</div>

<p>Quartermasters are a necessity—as signalmen, helmsmen,
and generally useful assistants in the navigation of the vessel.
They are the messengers for the officer of the watch, read
the log when sights are taken, or course is changed, and
assist generally.</p>

<p>Steering, however, should be done by all hands, the
quartermasters being relieved for at least half of their watch
by one of the seamen. This practice would result in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
largely increased number of competent helmsmen, and in an
increased efficiency all round.</p>

<p>Quartermasters should aim to become officers, and should
devote as much of their time as possible to study, in which
the deck officers are usually ready to assist.</p>

<p>All quartermasters should be certified lifeboat men,
and should be familiar with the handling of ship's boats.
They should be charged with the overhauling of the required
lifeboat equipment, under the direction of one of the officers.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
THE CARPENTER</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> carpenter occupies an important position on board
ship. He is one of the "idlers," works all day and turns in
at night, like an ordinary human being; in other words, he
stands no watches.</p>

<p>His duties, of course, are defined by his title, but on a
well-regulated vessel, the Carpenter, under orders from the
Chief Mate, to whom he reports in person, performs certain
standard tasks.</p>

<p><b>Sounding.</b> He has charge of the sounding; sounds the
bilges and tanks, and reports their condition each morning,
or when specially ordered.</p>

<p>In the event of grounding, or collision, one of the first
things to do is to sound bilges and wells in the vicinity of
the damage. This duty always falls to the Carpenter.</p>

<p><b>Tanks.</b> Any work done to the tanks—not directly under
the Chief Engineer—is attended to by the Carpenter.</p>

<p><b>Tools.</b> The Carpenter is responsible for all tools used
in the deck department—outside of marline spikes, fid, rigging
screws, etc., which belong to the Boatswain. He takes
care of his shop, keeps an inventory of his materials, and
turns same in to the Chief Mate for approval.</p>

<p><b>Cargo Ports.</b> The Carpenter should overhaul and attend
to the opening and closing of all cargo ports.</p>

<p><b>Hatches.</b> Hatches are opened and covered and the tarpaulins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
battened down by the Carpenter; he keeps an extra
supply of hatch wedges in his shop.</p>

<p><b>Deadlights and Light Ports.</b> The Carpenter is charged
with the good order and care of all deadlights and light
ports. He should examine all deadlights in 'tweendeck,
where cargo has been carried.</p>

<p><b>Fresh Water.</b> The Carpenter should examine all fresh
water tanks before filling. He should see them cement
washed, when necessary, and should be in attendance when
fresh water is taken on board. When double-bottom tanks
are being filled, he should see that vents are opened for the
escape of air, so they will be completely filled.</p>

<p><b>Decks.</b> The Carpenter is specially charged with the
caulking and repair of wooden decks. He should keep a
supply of deck plugs handy. Caulking is almost a lost art
today.</p>

<p><b>Booms—Masts.</b> The Carpenter is charged with the upkeep
of booms and masts. He should examine the masts
at the partners, whenever the vessel is unloaded. Runs of
rust should be noted and the state of the wedges and mast
coats reported to the Chief Mate, if necessary.</p>

<p>Old booms should be examined in the wake of bands,
and probed for dry rot at the heel. Checks and dangerous
cracks—probably puttied up—should be searched for and
reported to the Chief Mate.</p>

<p><b>Storm Oil.</b> The Carpenter should have charge of the
storm-oil tank, and should see that the drip cocks and pipes
leading to the hawse, or over side, are kept clear, and that
the supply of oil required by the U. S. Inspectors is on hand:</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></div>

<div class="misc">

<ol class="n">
 <li>Vessels of over 200 and not over 1,000 gross tons, 30 gallons.</li>
 <li>Vessels of over 1,000 and not over 3,000 gross tons, 40 gallons.</li>
 <li>Vessels of over 3,000 and not over 5,000 gross tons, 50 gallons.</li>
 <li>Vessels of over 5,000 gross tons shall carry at least 100 gallons.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p><b>General.</b> The modern ship carpenter is as much a worker
with iron and steel as he is with wood. His duty requires
that he be familiar with machinery—and his special charge
is the braking and releasing of the windlass, under the direction
of the Chief Mate.</p>

<p>A top-notch carpenter is a jewel, he is a scarce article
in these degenerate days of high wages and indifferent performance.

A good artisan can do no better than to go to sea as a
carpenter in a well-found modern steamer; the pay is good
he will have comfortable quarters, and good food, he will
also save money. This holds true of most billets aboard a
merchant vessel today.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
THE BOATSWAIN</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Boatswain, for a long time was not in favor on
American vessels, this prejudice being a survival of the hard
old sailing-ship days, after America had ceased to be great
with her white wings.</p>

<p>The cheese-paring policy of many owners denied the
common sense arrangement of having a Boatswain—a leading
man of the crew—to do the actual roustabout with the
men in holds and on deck. The Mates were supposed to
attend to such matters, and while they juggled hose, and
did other energetic, but senseless duties, other matters of
far greater importance went undone.</p>

<p>Owners are now generally alive to the fact that a Boatswain
makes the Chief Mate about ten times as useful as
an officer. He can plan work, attend to his duties and
inspections, while such matters as washing decks, mixing
paints, standing over gangs of chippers, or side cleaners,
goes on without interruption under the Boatswain.</p>

<p>The Duty of the Boatswain is so closely associated with
the duty of the Chief Mate, that it is more or less a matter
of repetition to enumerate just what he is supposed to look
after.</p>

<p>Under the Chief Mate, the Boatswain works the men; if
in a large vessel, with the assistance of a Boatswain's Mate.
At sea, the watches are divided between the Boatswain and
his Mate.</p>

<p>The Boatswain should be something more than an able
seaman, as the term is known today. Steamers do not carry
a sailmaker, and the Boatswain should be able to sew a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
seam, sew on a bolt rope, and fit and cut an awning, or
a staysail.</p>

<p>He should understand something about rigging—the
splicing of wire ropes—the turning in of thimbles—the
making and rigging of lifeboat sails (most of them on
merchant vessels are an abomination).</p>

<p><b>Boatswain's Orders.</b> A small book of Boatswains'
Orders, filled out by the Chief Mate helps to keep things
straight and the work on deck progressing. This is specially
necessary where the Chief Mate stands a bridge watch and
may be turned in for a part of the day.</p>

<p><b>Stands By.</b> The Boatswain or his Mate, whoever is on
deck, should always "stand by" for an emergency call from
the bridge, to attend to any work that the officer of the
watch may wish to have done.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
ABLE SEAMEN</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> able seaman of the present is an elusive bird who
draws twice as much pay as the Chief Mate of a three-skysail-yarder
earned in the slack days of the past, and his
knowledge of seamanship is in the ratio of nothing to everything.
The modern A.B. just is; he arrives at the office of
the Shipping Commissioner, when the crew sign on, and he
is there when they pay off, that is, if he has not become
tired of travel, while on the voyage, and stopped off for rest
in foreign ports.</p>

<p>However, better days are dawning for the men of the
sea; official recognition of the seaman, is carrying with it
certain requirements as to real ability. Higher standards
bring with them increased respect and less friction between
officers and men. No mate, worthy of the name, will find
fault with a man who can "surge" a ten-inch manila line
when springing a vessel around a pier, or who can turn a
splice into a wire mooring line—any seaman worthy of his
pay should be able to do such things and many others—the
official standards, as set forth in a Department of Commerce
circular follow:</p>

<div class="indent">

 <p class="center">ABLE SEAMEN<br />
 <i>Department of Commerce Circular No. 264</i></p>

 <p>By virtue of the authority conferred by section 13, of the act approved
 March 4, 1915, which provides "That upon examination, under rules
 prescribed by the Department of Commerce as to eyesight, hearing,
 physical condition, and knowledge of the duties of seamanship

 a person found competent may be rated as able seaman after having
 served on deck twelve months at sea, or on the Great Lakes," the
 following regulations are prescribed for determining the knowledge of
 the duties of seamanship of such persons who make application for
 examination for a certificate of service as able seaman:</p>

 <p>1. Any person who has had twelve months' service on deck at sea or on
 the Great Lakes on any vessel of 100 tons gross and upward (except
 those navigating rivers exclusively and the smaller inland lakes, and
 except fishing or whaling vessels or yachts), including decked fishing
 vessels, naval vessels, and coast-guard vessels, may make application
 to any board of local inspectors for a certificate of service as able
 seaman, and upon proof being made to said board by affidavit as to
 service, and examination as to physical condition and knowledge of the
 duties of seamanship, showing the nationality and age of the applicant
 and the vessel or vessels on which he has had service, the board of
 local inspectors shall issue to said applicant a certificate of service
 which shall be retained by him and be accepted as prima facie evidence
 of his rating as able seaman.</p>

 <p>2. No person shall be examined who does not produce satisfactory
 affidavit or affidavits that he has served at sea or on the Great Lakes
 as prescribed in paragraph 1.</p>

 <p>3. Each applicant shall pass the prescribed physical examination before
 a medical officer of the Public Health Service before being permitted
 to take the examination to determine his knowledge of the duties of
 seamanship.</p>

 <p>4. The professional examination to determine the applicant's knowledge
 of the duties of seamanship shall be oral, and shall be conducted in
 the form of questions and answers and by practical tests. The applicant
 shall be examined in each of the prescribed subjects and given a mark
 in each based on a scale of 100.</p>

 <p>5. No person shall be recommended for or shall receive the certificate
 of service as able seaman who fails to attain a general average of
 merit of 70 per cent.</p>

 <p>6. The professional examination may be conducted by an officer of the
 United States Navy, the Coast Guard, Lighthouse Service, Coast and
 Geodetic Survey, Navigation Service, or any other marine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
 officer designated by the Secretary of Commerce. When any such officer
 conducts the examination the board of local inspectors shall issue to
 the applicant a certificate of service as able seaman upon receiving
 notice in writing from such an officer that the applicant has passed
 the prescribed examination as to the knowledge of the duties of
 seamanship.</p>

 <p>7. The professional examination will be conducted as concisely as
 possible, with the view of determining the applicant's qualifications,
 and will embrace the following subjects:</p>

</div>

<div class="indent2">

 <p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Boxing the compass.</i>—The applicant will be required
 to box the compass by points or degrees, according to the experience he
 has had in the use of either method.</p>

 <p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Lights and fog signals.</i>—A knowledge will be required
 of the running and anchor lights for steam and sailing vessels on the
 sea, inland waters, or Great Lakes, and a like knowledge of fog
 signals, according to the waters on which the applicant has served.</p>

 <p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Signals for starting, stopping, slowing down, and backing
 the engines of steam vessels.</i>—This examination will be restricted
 to the signals in use on the sea, or Great Lakes, according to the
 waters on which the applicant has served. In view of the widespread use
 of engine telegraphs, knowledge of engine bell signals, while deemed
 advantageous, will not be <i>required</i> if in other respects the
 candidate qualified.</p>

 <p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Passing signals for steam vessels.</i>—To be confined to
 vessels meeting or passing under ordinary conditions.</p>

 <p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Knotting, bending, splicing, and hitching.</i>—The
 applicant will be required to make a few of the principal knots, bends,
 splices, and hitches in common use by sailormen.</p>

 <p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Ability to pull an oar.</i>—The applicant's knowledge of
 pulling an oar will be determined by actual trial in a boat.</p>

 <p>(<i>g</i>) <i>Clearing away, lowering, and getting away from the
 ship.</i>—The applicant's ability will be determined by actual trial
 aboard ship.</p>

 <p>(<i>h</i>) <i>Handling boats at sea.</i>—This examination will include
 questions relative to the proper handling of a boat in running before a
 heavy sea; in pulling into a sea; the trim of the boat; and steering
 with an oar, tiller, or yoke.</p>

 <p>(<i>i</i>) <i>Knowledge of nautical terms.</i>—The applicant will be
 required to definitely locate different parts of a ship, and to give
 the names of the different masts, sails, rigging davits, etc.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></div>

 <p>(<i>j</i>) <i>Steering.</i>—The applicant will be required to
 demonstrate his knowledge of handling the wheel of a steamer by obeying
 orders passed to him as "wheelman."</p>

</div>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right3"><span class="smcap">William C. Redfield</span>,</div>
<div class="right1"><i>Secretary</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>The able seaman should also know the following:</p>

<div class="misc">

<ol class="n">
 <li>Markings and use of the hand lead.</li>
 <li>Handling of a boat under sail.</li>
 <li>Running a steam winch.</li>
 <li>Slinging a scaffold plank.</li>
 <li>Use of the life line and breeches buoy—that is what to do
   on the ship end of the line.</li>
 <li>Use of rockets.</li>
 <li>Use of line-throwing gun.</li>
 <li>Use of the heaving line.</li>
 <li>Slinging a cask.</li>
 <li>Sewing canvas.</li>
 <li>International Code Flags.</li>
 <li>Hand semaphore signals.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>An able seaman might know a lot more, but the above
coupled with the things mentioned by Mr. Redfield, should
turn him out as a competent American sailorman.</p>

<p>The following common sense advice taken from the
pages of the Coast Seamen's Journal, on "Teaching Seamanship",
is given—it clearly sets forth the things a modern
merchant sailorman should know.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>Were we asked to prescribe a course of instruction in seamanship for
beginners, we should arrange it somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>First—Teach the pupil the names, locations and uses of the different
parts of the ship, and of her spars, sails, standing and running
riggings; together with the meaning of such terms as port, starboard,
lee, weather, astern, ahead, abaft, aloft and alow.</p>

<p>Second—Show him how to box the compass and, if possible, how to steer.
Explain to him the meaning of the commands, "Hard up" and "Hard down
the helm," and why he must turn the wheel to port when ordered to
starboard the helm, and vice versa. Also show him the marks on the hand
leadline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
Third—Teach him how to whip a rope; how to make a clinch; how to tie a
reef knot; how to make the bends and hitches commonly used on a ship,
such as a bowline, clove hitch, sheet bend, anchor bend, rolling hitch,
timber hitch, bow line on a bight, cat's paw, blackwall hitch,
midshipman's hitch, single carrick bend, sheepshank, etc. Also how to
put on a strop and how to shorten a cargo sling.</p>

<p>Fourth—Take up splicing and knotting—eye splice, short splice, long
splice, crown and wall knot, lanyard knot and manrope knot. Instruct
the learner how to worm, parcel and serve a rope; how to put on a
seizing; how to pass the head earing on a sail; how to put on a
ratline; how to make plain sennit and paunch mats, and explain their
uses.</p>

<p>Fifth—Give the pupils a thorough drilling in the loosing, setting,
taking in, reefing and furling of the sails; in bracing the yards; in
catting and fishing the anchors; in pulling boats and handling of oars;
in sending the lighter spars down on deck and up again, and such other
maneuvers as are generally recognized as necessary to the safe
navigation of ships. In fact, these drills might, with great benefit to
the learners, alternate daily with the instruction in the other details
of seamanship.</p>

<p>A willing, healthy young fellow, who has gone through a course of
training as outlined above, will, with two or three months of actual
seafaring behind him, be well worth his keep and wages as a sailor. The
experience he will then be daily gaining will soon fill up the gaps in
his nautical education necessarily left by his hurried training ship
instruction, till in another year or two he will have developed into a
full-fledged able seaman. If he then chooses to take up with "fancy
work"—and they usually do—all good and well. But safety first. And
safety for a man before the mast lies in knowing how to perform in a
shipshape manner the daily, prosaic, everyday routine duties of an
able seaman.</p>

</div>

<p>The laws governing the American Seaman, in which are
incorporated the laws known as the "Seamen's Act," follow.
They are of interest to every one who is governed by them.
Laws are made to provide for the proper regulation of
our affairs, and no matter how wordy, the intent is to uphold
recognized authority, and be just to all—<b>sea lawyers take
notice</b>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
U. S. NAVIGATION LAWS GOVERNING MERCHANT SEAMEN</h2>

<h3>Definitions.</h3>

<p>In the construction of this Title [R. S., 4501-4613], every person
having the command of any vessel belonging to any citizen of the
United States shall be deemed to be the "master" thereof; and
every person (apprentices excepted) who shall be employed or engaged
to serve in any capacity on board the same shall be deemed and
taken to be a "seaman;" and the term "vessel" shall be understood
to comprehend every description of vessel navigating on any
sea or channel, lake or river, to which the provisions of this Title
may be applicable, and the term "owner" shall be taken and understood
to comprehend all the several persons, if more than one, to
whom the vessel shall belong. (R. S., 4612.)</p>

<h3>Exemption for militia duty.</h3>

<p>Pilots, mariners actually employed in the sea service of any citizen
or merchant within the United States, and all persons who are
exempted by the laws of the respective States or Territories shall be
exempted from militia duty, without regard to age. (Jan. 26, 1903;
sec. 2.)</p>

<h3>Form of articles of agreement.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">United States of America.</span></p>

<p>(Date and place of first signature of agreement, including name of
shipping-office.)</p>

<p>It is agreed between the master and seamen or mariners of the
<span class="condense">————</span> <span class="condense">————</span> ,
of which <span class="condense">————</span> <span class="condense">————</span>
is at present master, or whoever shall go for master, now bound from the port of
<span class="condense">————</span> , <span class="condense">————</span> ,
to <span class="condense">————</span> , <span class="condense">————</span> ,
(here the voyage is to be described, and the places named at which the
vessel is to touch, or if that cannot be done, the
general nature and probable length of the voyage is to be stated.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
And the said crew agree to conduct themselves in an orderly,
faithful, honest, and sober manner, and to be at all times diligent
in their respective duties, and to be obedient to the lawful commands
of the said master, or of any person who shall lawfully succeed him,
and of their superior officers in everything relating to the vessel,
and the stores and cargo thereof, whether on board, in boats, or on
shore; and in consideration of which service, to be duly performed,
the said master hereby agrees to pay the said crew, as wages, the sums
against their names respectively expressed, and to supply them with
provisions according to the annexed scale. And it is hereby agreed
that any embezzlement, or willful or negligent destruction of any
part of the vessel's cargo or stores, shall be made good to the owner
out of the wages of the person guilty of the same; and if any person
enters himself as qualified for a duty which he proves himself
incompetent to perform, his wages shall be reduced in proportion
to his incompetency. And it is also agreed that if any member of
the crew considers himself to be aggrieved by any breach of the agreement
or otherwise, he shall represent the same to the master or
officer in charge of the vessel, in a quiet and orderly manner, who shall
thereupon take such steps as the case may require. And it is also
agreed that (here any other stipulations may be inserted to which the
parties agree, and which are not contrary to law).</p>

<p>In witness whereof the said parties have subscribed their names
hereto, on the days against their respective signatures mentioned.</p>

<p>Signed by <span class="condense">————</span> <span class="condense">————</span> ,
master, on the <span class="condense">————</span> day of <span class="condense">————</span> ,
eighteen hundred and <span class="condense">————</span> .</p>

<h3>Naturalization and citizenship of seamen.</h3>

<p>Every seaman, being a foreigner, who declares his intention of
becoming a citizen of the United States in any competent court, and
shall have served three years on board of a merchant vessel of the
United States subsequent to the date of such declaration, may, on
his application to any competent court, and the production of his
certificate of discharge and good conduct during that time, together
with the certificate of his declaration of intention to become a citizen,
be admitted a citizen of the United States; and every seaman, being
a foreigner, shall, after his declaration of intention to become a citizen
of the United States, and after he shall have served such three
years, be deemed a citizen of the United States for the purpose of
manning and serving on board any merchant-vessel of the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
States, anything to the contrary in any act of Congress notwithstanding;
but such seaman shall, for all purposes of protection as an
American citizen, be deemed such, after the filing of his declaration
of intention to become such citizen. (R. S., 2174.)</p>

<p>The collector of every district shall keep a book or books, in
which, at the request of any seaman, being a citizen of the United
States of America, and producing proof of his citizenship, authenticated
in the manner hereinafter directed, he shall enter the name of
such seaman, and shall deliver to him a certificate, in the following
form, that is to say: "I, A. B., collector of the district of D., do hereby
certify, that E. F., an American seaman, aged <span class="condense">————</span> years,
or thereabouts, of the height of <span class="condense">————</span> feet
<span class="condense">————</span> inches, (describing the
said seaman as particularly as may be,) has, this day, produced to
me proof in the manner directed by law; and I do hereby certify
that the said E. F. is a citizen of the United States of America.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and seal of office,
this <span class="condense">————</span> day of <span class="condense">————</span> ."
It shall be the duty of the collectors to file and preserve the proofs of
citizenship so produced. (R. S., 4588; June 19, 1886.)</p>

<p>The collector of every port of entry in the United States shall
send a list of the seaman to whom certificates of citizenship have been
granted, once every three months, to the Secretary of State [together
with an account of such impressments or detentions, as shall appear,
by the protests of the masters, to have taken place.] (R. S., 4591.)</p>

<h3>Shipping officers.</h3>

<p>The general duties of a shipping-commissioner shall be:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> To afford facilities for engaging seamen by keeping a
register of their names and characters.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> To superintend their engagement and discharge, in manner
prescribed by law.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> To provide means for securing the presence on board at
the proper times of men who are so engaged.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> To facilitate the making of apprenticeships to the sea
service.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> To perform such other duties relating to merchant seamen
or merchant ships as are now or may hereafter be required by law.</p>

</div>

<p>In any port in which no shipping-commissioner shall have been
appointed, the whole or any part of the business of a shipping-commissioner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
shall be conducted by the collector or deputy collector of
customs of such port; and in respect of such business such custom-house
shall be deemed a shipping-office, and the collector or deputy
collector of customs to whom such business shall be committed,
shall, for all purposes, be deemed a shipping-commissioner within
the meaning of this Title [R. S., 4501-4613]. (R. S., 4503.)</p>

<p>Every shipping-commissioner, and every clerk or employé in any
shipping-office, who demands or receives any remuneration whatever,
either directly or indirectly, for hiring or supplying any seaman for
any merchant-vessels, excepting the lawful fees payable under this
Title [R. S., 4501-4613], shall, for every such offense, be liable to a
penalty of not more than two hundred dollars. [Fees payable by
individuals abolished June 19, 1886.] (R. S., 4595; Mar. 4, 1911;
June 19, 1886; R. S., 4508.)</p>

<h3>Illegal shipments.</h3>

<p>Whoever, with intent that any person shall perform service or
labor of any kind on board of any vessel engaged in trade and commerce
among the several States or with foreign nations, or on board
of any vessel of the United States engaged in navigating the high
seas or any navigable water of the United States, shall procure or
induce, or attempt to procure or induce, another, by force or threats
or by representations which he knows or believes to be untrue, or
while the person so procured or induced is intoxicated or under the
influence of any drug, to go on board of any such vessel, or to sign or in
anywise enter into any agreement to go on board of any such vessel
to perform service or labor thereon; or whoever shall knowingly
detain on board of any such vessel any person so procured or induced
to go on board thereof, or to enter into any agreement to go on board
thereof, by any means herein defined; or whoever shall knowingly
aid or abet in the doing of any of the things herein made unlawful,
shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars, or imprisoned not
more than one year, or both. (Mar. 4, 1909; sec. 82; Repeals act
of Mar. 2, 1907.)</p>

<p>All shipments of seamen made contrary to the provisions of any
act of Congress shall be void; and any seaman so shipped may leave
the service at any time, and shall be entitled to recover the highest
rate of wages of the port from which the seaman was shipped, or the
sum agreed to be given him at his shipment. (R. S., 4523.)</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></div>

<h3>Owners or masters may ship seamen in certain cases.</h3>

<p>Any person other than a commissioner under this Title [R. S.,
4501-4613], who shall perform or attempt to perform, either directly
or indirectly, the duties which are by this Title set forth as pertaining
to a shipping-commissioner, shall be liable to a penalty of not
more than five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Nothing in this Title [R. S., 4501-4613], however, shall prevent
the owner, or consignee, or master of any vessel except vessels bound
from a port in the United States to any foreign port, other than vessels
engaged in trade between the United States and the British North
American possessions, or the West India Islands, or the republic of
Mexico, and vessels of the burden of seventy-five tons or upward
bound from a port on the Atlantic to a port on the Pacific, or vice
versa, from performing, himself, so far as his vessel is concerned, the
duties of shipping-commissioner under this Title. Whenever the
master of any vessel shall engage his crew, or any part of the same, in
any collection-district where no shipping-commissioner shall have been
appointed, he may perform for himself the duties of such commissioner.
(R. S., 4504.)</p>

<h3>Apprentices.</h3>

<p>Every shipping-commissioner appointed under this Title [R. S.,
4501-4613] shall, if applied to for the purpose of apprenticing boys
to the sea-service, by any master or owner of a vessel, or by any
person legally qualified, give such assistance as is in his power for
facilitating the making of such apprenticeships; but the shipping-commissioner
shall ascertain that the boy has voluntarily consented
to be bound, and that the parents or guardian of such boy have consented
to such apprenticeship, and that he has attained the age of
twelve years, and is of sufficient health and strength, and that the
master to whom such boy is to be bound is a proper person for the
purpose. Such apprenticeship shall terminate when the apprentice
becomes eighteen years of age. The shipping-commissioner shall
keep a register of all indentures of apprenticeship made before him.
(R. S., 4509.)</p>

<p>The master of every foreign-going vessel shall, before carrying
any apprentice to sea from any place in the United States, cause such
apprentice to appear before the shipping-commissioner before whom
the crew is engaged, and shall produce to him the indenture by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
such apprentice is bound, and the assignment or assignments thereof,
if any; and the name of the apprentice, with the date of the indenture
and of the assignment or assignments thereof, if any, shall be entered
on the agreement; which shall be in the form, as near as may be,
given in the table marked "A" in the schedule annexed to this Title
[R. S., 4501-4613]; and no such assignment shall be made without
the approval of a commissioner, of the apprentice, and of his
parents or his guardian. For any violation of this section, the master
shall be liable to a penalty of not more than one hundred dollars.
(R. S., 4510.)</p>

<h3>Agreement to ship in foreign trade.</h3>

<p>The master of every vessel bound from a port in the United
States to any foreign port other than vessels engaged in trade between
the United States and the British North American possessions, or
the West India Islands, or the republic of Mexico, or of any vessel
of the burden of seventy-five tons or upward, bound from a port on
the Atlantic to a port on the Pacific, or vice versa, shall, before he
proceeds oh such voyage, make an agreement, in writing or in print,
with every seaman whom he carries to sea as one of the crew, in the
manner hereinafter mentioned; and every such agreement shall be,
as near as may be, in the form given in the table Marked A, in the
schedule annexed to this Title [R. S., 4501-4613], and shall be dated
at the time of the first signature thereof, and shall be signed by the
master before any seaman signs the same, and shall contain the
following particulars:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> The nature and, as far as practicable, the duration of
the intended voyage or engagement, and the port or country at which the
voyage is to terminate.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> The number and description of the crew, specifying their
respective employments.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> The time at which each seaman is to be on board, to begin
work.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> The capacity in which each seaman is to serve.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> The amount of wages which each seaman is to receive.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i> A scale of the provisions which are to be furnished to
each seaman.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i> Any regulations as to conduct on board and as to fines,
short allowances of provisions, or other lawful punishments for
misconduct, which may be sanctioned by Congress or authorized by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
Secretary of Commerce and Labor not contrary to or not otherwise
provided for by law, which the parties agree to adopt.</p>

<p><i>Eighth.</i> Any stipulations in reference to allotment of wages, or
other matters not contrary to law. [Repealed so far as relates to
allotments in trade between the United States, Dominion of Canada,
Newfoundland, the West Indies and Mexico, and coasting trade of the
United States, except between Atlantic and Pacific ports, by sec. 25 of
Act of December 21, 1898.] (R. S., 4511; Mar. 3, 1897; sec. 19; Feb.
14, 1903; sec. 10; June 26, 1884; sec. 10; Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 25.)</p>

</div>

<p>The following rules shall be observed with respect to agreements:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> Every agreement except such as are otherwise specially
provided for, shall be signed by each seaman in the presence of a
shipping-commissioner.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> When the crew is first engaged the agreement shall be
signed in duplicate, and one part shall be retained by the
shipping-commissioner, and the other part shall contain a special place
or form for the description and signatures of persons engaged
subsequently to the first departure of the ship, and shall be delivered
to the master.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> Every agreement entered into before a
shipping-commissioner shall be acknowledged and certified under the
hand and official seal of such commissioner. The certificate of
acknowledgment shall be indorsed on or annexed to the agreement; and
shall be in the following form:</p>

</div>

<div class="indent2">

<p>"State of <span class="condense">————</span> , County of <span class="condense">————</span> :</p>

<p>"On this <span class="condense">————</span> day of <span class="condense">————</span> ,
personally appeared before me, a shipping-commissioner in and for the
said county, A. B., C. D., and E. F., severally known to me to be the
same persons who executed the foregoing instrument, who each for himself
acknowledged to me that he had read or had heard read the same; that he
was by me made acquainted with the conditions thereof, and understood
the same; and that, while sober and not in a state of intoxication, he
signed it freely and voluntarily, for the uses and purposes therein
mentioned." (R. S., 4512.)</p>

</div>

<p>Section 4511 shall not apply to masters of vessels where the seamen
are by custom or agreement entitled to participate in the profits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
or result of a cruise or voyage, nor to masters of coastwise nor to
masters of lake-going vessels that touch at foreign ports; but seamen
may, by agreement, serve on board such vessels a definite time, or,
on the return of any vessel to a port in the United States, may reship
and sail in the same vessel on another voyage, without the payment
of additional fees to the shipping-commissioner.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Sec. 4511, however, does apply in part to masters of
coastwise vessels whose crews are shipped under provisions of the
act of Feb. 18, 1895.] (R. S., 4513; Feb. 18, 1895; June 19, 1886.)</p>

<p>The master shall, at the commencement of every voyage or
engagement, cause a legible copy of the agreement, omitting signatures,
to be placed or posted up in such part of the vessel as to be
accessible to the crew; and on default shall be liable to a penalty
of not more than one hundred dollars. (R. S., 4519.)</p>

<h3>Period of engagement.</h3>

<p>A master of a vessel in the foreign trade may engage a seaman at
any port in the United States, in the manner provided by law, to
serve on a voyage to any port, or for the round trip from and to the
port of departure, or for a definite time, whatever the destination.
The master of a vessel making regular and stated trips between the
United States and a foreign country may engage a seaman for one
or more round trips, or for a definite time, or on the return of said
vessel to the United States may reship such seamen for another
voyage in the same vessel, in the manner provided by law, without
the payment of additional fees to any officer for such reshipment or
re-engagement. (June 26, 1884; sec. 19.)</p>

<h3>Penalty for shipment without agreement.</h3>

<p>If any person shall be carried to sea, as one of the crew on board
of any vessel making a voyage as hereinbefore specified, without
entering into an agreement with the master of such vessel, in the form
and manner, and at the place and times in such cases required, the
vessel shall be held liable for each such offense to a penalty of not
more than two hundred dollars. But the vessel shall not be held
liable for any person carried to sea, who shall have secretly stowed
away himself without the knowledge of the master, mate, or of any
of the officers of the vessel, or who shall have falsely personated himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
to the master, mate, or officers of the vessel, for the purpose of
being carried to sea. (R. S., 4514.)</p>

<p>If any master, mate, or other officer of a vessel knowingly receives,
or accepts, to be entered on board of any merchant-vessel,
any seaman who has been engaged or supplied contrary to the provisions
of this Title [R. S., 4501-4613], the vessel on board of which
such seaman shall be found shall, for every such seaman, be liable to
a penalty of not more than two hundred dollars. (R. S., 4515.)</p>

<h3>Shipment in foreign ports before consuls.</h3>

<p>Every master of a merchant-vessel who engages any seaman at
a place out of the United States, in which there is a consular officer
or commercial agent, shall, before carrying such seaman to sea,
procure the sanction of such officer, and shall engage seamen in his
presence; and the rules governing the engagement of seamen before
a shipping-commissioner in the United States, shall apply to such
engagements made before a consular officer or commercial agent;
and upon every such engagement the consular officer or commercial
agent shall indorse upon the agreement his sanction thereof, and an
attestation to the effect that the same has been signed in his presence,
and otherwise duly made. (R. S., 4517.)</p>

<p>Every master who engages any seaman in any place in which
there is a consular officer or commercial agent, otherwise than as
required by the preceding section, shall incur a penalty of not more
than one hundred dollars, for which penalty the vessel shall be held
liable.</p>

<p>Every master of a vessel in the foreign trade may engage any
seaman at any port out of the United States, in the manner provided
by law, to serve for one or more round trips from and to the
port of departure, or for a definite time, whatever the destination;
and the master of a vessel clearing from a port of the United States
with one or more seamen engaged in a foreign port as herein provided
shall not be required to reship in a port of the United States the seamen
so engaged. (R. S., 4518; June 26, 1884; sec. 20; Mar. 3,
1897; sec. 3.)</p>

<h3>Crew list.</h3>

<p>Before a clearance is granted to any vessel bound on a foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
voyage or engaged in the whale-fishery, the master thereof shall
deliver to the collector of the customs a list containing the names,
places of birth and residence, and description of the persons who
compose his ship's company; to which list the oath of the captain
shall be annexed, that the list contains the names of his crew,
together with the places of their birth and residence, as far as he can
ascertain them; and the collector shall deliver him a certified copy
thereof. (R. S., 4573; June 19, 1886.)</p>

<p>In all cases of private vessels of the United States sailing from a
port in the United States to a foreign port, the list of the crew shall
be examined by the collector for the district from which the vessel
shall clear, and if approved of by him, shall be certified accordingly.
No person shall be admitted or employed on board of any such
vessel unless his name shall have been entered in the list of the crew,
approved and certified by the collector for the district from which
the vessel shall clear. The collector, before he delivers the list of
the crew, approved and certified, to the master or proper officer of
the vessel to which the same belongs, shall cause the same to be recorded
in a book by him for that purpose to be provided, and the
record shall be open for the inspection of all persons, and a certified
copy thereof shall be admitted in evidence in any court in which any
question may arise under any of the provisions of this Title [R. S.,
4501-4613.] (R. S., 4574.)</p>

<h3>Failure to produce crew.</h3>

<p>The master of every vessel bound on a foreign voyage or engaged
in the whale fishery shall exhibit the certified copy of the list of the
crew to the first boarding officer at the first port in the United States
at which he shall arrive on his return, and also produce the persons
named therein to the boarding officer, whose duty it shall be to examine
the men with such list and to report the same to the collector;
and it shall be the duty of the collector at the port of arrival,
where the same is different from the port from which the vessel originally
sailed, to transmit a copy of the list so reported to him to the
collector of the port from which such vessel originally sailed. For
each failure to produce any person on the certified copy of the list
of the crew the master and owner shall be severally liable to a penalty
of four hundred dollars, to be sued for, prosecuted, and disposed of in
such manner as penalties and forfeitures which may be incurred for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
offenses against the laws relating to the collection of duties; but such
penalties shall not be incurred on account of the master not producing
to the first boarding officer any of the persons contained in the
list who may have been discharged in a foreign country with the consent
of the consul, vice-consul, commercial agent, or vice-commercial
agent there residing, certified in writing, under the hand and official
seal, to be produced to the collector with the other persons composing
the crew, nor on account of any such person dying or absconding
or being forcibly impressed into other service of which satisfactory
proof shall also be exhibited to the collector. (R. S., 4576; Mar. 3,
1897; sec. 3.)</p>

<h3>Papers relating to crew.</h3>

<p>The following rules shall be observed with reference to vessels
bound on any foreign voyage:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> The duplicate list of the ship's company, required to be
made out by the master and delivered to the collector of the customs,
under section forty-five hundred and seventy-three, shall be a fair
copy in one uniform handwriting, without erasure or interlineation.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> It shall be the duty of the owners of every such vessel
to obtain from the collector of the customs of the district from which
the clearance is made, a true and certified copy of the
shipping-articles, containing the names of the crew, which shall be
written in a uniform hand, without erasures or interlineations.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> These documents, which shall be deemed to contain all the
conditions of contract with the crew as to their service, pay, voyage,
and all other things, shall be produced by the master, and laid before
any consul, or other commercial agent of the United States, whenever he
may deem their contents necessary to enable him to discharge the duties
imposed upon him by law toward any mariner applying to him for his aid
or assistance.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> All interlineations, erasures, or writing in a hand
different from that in which such duplicates were originally made,
shall be deemed fraudulent alterations, working no change in such
papers, unless satisfactorily explained in a manner consistent with
innocent purposes and the provisions of law which guard the rights of
mariners.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> If any master of a vessel shall proceed on a foreign
voyage without the documents herein required, or refuse to produce them
when required, or to perform the duties imposed by this section, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
shall violate the provisions thereof, he shall be liable to each and
every individual injured thereby in damages, to be recovered in any
court of the United States in the district where such delinquent may
reside or be found, and in addition thereto be punishable by a fine of
one hundred dollars for each offense.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i> It shall be the duty of the boarding-officer to report
all violations of this section to the collector of the port where any
vessel may arrive, and the collector shall report the same to the
Secretary of Commerce and to the United States attorney in his
district. (R. S., 4575; Feb. 14. 1903; sec. 10.)</p>

</div>

<h3>Shipment of seamen in the coasting or near-by foreign trade.</h3>

<p>None of the provisions of an act entitled "An act to authorize
the appointment of shipping commissioners by the several circuit
courts of the United States to superintend the shipping and discharge
of seamen engaged in merchant ships belonging to the United States,
and for the further protection of seamen" shall apply to sail or
steam vessels engaged in the coastwise trade, (except the coastwise
trade between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts,) or in the lake-going
trade touching at foreign ports or otherwise, or in the trade
between the United States and the British North American possessions,
or in any case where the seamen are by custom or agreement
entitled to participate in the profits or result of a cruise, or voyage.
(June 9, 1874; June 19, 1886; Feb. 18, 1895.)</p>

<p>Shipping commissioners may ship and discharge crews for any
vessel engaged in the coastwise trade, or the trade between the
United States and the Dominion of Canada, or Newfoundland, or
the West Indies, or the Republic of Mexico, at the request of the master
or owner of such vessel, the shipping and discharging fees in such
cases to be one-half that prescribed by section forty-six hundred
and twelve of the Revised Statutes, for the purpose of determining
the compensation of shipping commissioners. (June 19, 1886;
sec. 2.)</p>

<p>When a crew is shipped by a shipping commissioner for any
American vessel in the coastwise trade, or the trade between the
United States and the Dominion of Canada, or New Foundland,
or the West Indies, or Mexico, as authorized by section two of an
Act approved June nineteenth, eighteen hundred and eighty-six,
entitled "An Act to abolish certain fees for official services to American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
vessels, and to amend the laws relating to shipping commissioners,
seamen, and owners of vessels, and for other purposes," an agreement
shall be made with each seaman engaged as one of such crew in
the same manner as is provided by Sections four thousand five hundred
and eleven and four thousand five hundred and twelve of the Revised
Statutes, not however including the sixth and eighth items of Section
four thousand five hundred and eleven; and such agreement
shall be posted as provided in Section four thousand five hundred
and nineteen, and such seamen shall be discharged and receive their
wages as provided by the first clause of Section four thousand five
hundred and twenty-nine and also by Sections four thousand five
hundred and twenty-six, four thousand five hundred and twenty-seven,

five hundred and fifty-four and four thousand six hundred and two
of the Revised Statutes; but in all other respects such shipments
of seamen and such shipping agreement shall be regarded as if both
shipment and agreement had been entered into between the master
of a vessel and a seaman without going before a shipping commissioner.
(Feb. 18,1895; Mar. 3,1897; sec. 8; Dec. 21,1898; sec. 25;

<h3>Agreement in coasting trade not before commissioner.</h3>

<p>Every master of any vessel of the burden of fifty tons or upward,
bound from a port in one State to a port in any other than an adjoining
State, except vessels of the burden of seventy-five tons or upward,
bound from a port on the Atlantic to a port on the Pacific, or vice
versa, shall, before he proceeds on such voyage, make an agreement
in writing or in print, with every seaman on board such vessel
except such as shall be apprentice or servant to himself or owners,
declaring the voyage or term of time for which such seaman shall be
shipped. (R. S., 4520.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
If any master of such vessel of the burden of fifty tons or upward
shall carry out any seaman or mariner, except apprentices or servants,
without such contract or agreement being first made and signed by
the seamen, such master shall pay to every such seaman the highest
price or wages which shall have been given at the port or place
where such seaman was shipped, for a similar voyage, within three
months next before the time of such shipping, if such seaman shall
perform such voyage; or if not, then for such time as he shall continue
to do duty on board such vessel; and shall moreover be liable to a
penalty of twenty dollars for every such seaman, recoverable,
one-half to the use of the person prosecuting for the same, and the
other half to the use of the United States. Any seaman who has
not signed such a contract shall not be bound by the regulations nor
subject to the penalties and forfeitures contained in this Title [R. S.,
4501-4613]. (R. S., 4521.)</p>

<p>At the foot of every such contract to ship upon such a vessel of
the burden of fifty tons or upward there shall be a memorandum in
writing of the day and the hour when such seamen who shipped and
subscribed shall render himself on board to begin the voyage agreed
upon. If any seaman shall neglect to render himself on board the
vessel for which he has shipped at the time mentioned in such memorandum
without giving twenty-four hours' notice of his inability to
do so, and if the master of the vessel shall, on the day in which such
neglect happened, make an entry in the log book of such vessel of
the name of such seaman, and shall in like manner note the time
that he so neglected to render himself after the time appointed, then
every such seaman shall forfeit for every hour which he shall so neglect
to render himself one-half of one day's pay, according to the rate of
wages agreed upon, to be deducted out of the wages. If any such seaman
shall wholly neglect to render himself on board of such vessel,
or having rendered himself on board shall afterwards desert, he shall
forfeit all of his wages or emoluments which he has then earned.
[This section shall not apply to fishing or whaling vessels or yachts,
Dec. 21, 1898, sec. 26.] (R. S., 4522; Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 2.)</p>

<h3>Discharge in foreign trade.</h3>

<p>All seamen discharged in the United States from merchant vessels
engaged in voyages from a port in the United States to any foreign
port, or, being of the burden of seventy-five tons or upward, from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
port on the Atlantic to a port on the Pacific, or vice versa, shall be
discharged and receive their wages in the presence of a duly authorized
shipping-commissioner under this Title [R. S., 4501-4613], except in
cases where some competent court otherwise directs; and any master
or owner of any such vessel who discharges any such seaman belonging
thereto, or pays his wages within the United States in any other
manner, shall be liable to a penalty of not more than fifty dollars.
(R. S., 4549.)</p>

<p>Every master shall, not less than forty-eight hours before paying
off or discharging any seaman, deliver to him, or, if he is to be discharged
before a shipping-commissioner, to such shipping-commissioner,
a full and true account of his wages, and all deductions to
be made therefrom on any account whatsoever; and in default
shall, for each offense, be liable to a penalty of not more than fifty
dollars. No deduction from the wages of any seaman except in
respect of some matter happening after such delivery shall be allowed,
unless it is included in the account delivered; and the master shall,
during the voyage, enter the various matters in respect to which such
deductions are made, with the amounts of the respective deductions
as they occur, in the official log-book, and shall, if required, produce
such book at the time of the payment of wages, and, also, upon the
hearing, before any competent authority, of any complaint or question
relating to such payment. (R. S., 4550.)</p>

<p>Upon the discharge of any seaman, or upon payment of his
wages, the master shall sign and give him a certificate of discharge,
specifying the period of his service and the time and place of his
discharge, in the form marked Table B in the schedule annexed to
this Title [R. S., 4501-4613]; and every master who fails to sign and
give to such seaman such certificate and discharge, shall, for each
such offense, incur a penalty not exceeding fifty dollars. But whenever
the master shall discharge his crew or any part thereof in any
collection-district where no shipping-commissioner has been appointed,
he may perform for himself the duties of such commissioner. (R. S.,
4551.)</p>

<h3>Discharge in foreign ports.</h3>

<p>Upon the application of the master of any vessel to a consular
officer to discharge a seaman, or upon the application of any seaman
for his own discharge, if it appears to such officer that said seaman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
has completed his shipping agreement, or is entitled to his discharge
under any act of Congress or according to the general principles or
usages of maritime law as recognized in the United States, such
officer shall discharge said seaman, and require from the master of
said vessel, before such discharge shall be made, payment of the wages
which may then be due said seaman; but no payment of extra wages
shall be required by any consular officer upon such discharge of
any seaman except as provided in this act. (R. S., 4580; June 26,
1884; sec. 2.)</p>

<p>If any consular officer, when discharging any seaman, shall neglect
to require the payment of and collect the arrears of wages and extra
wages required to be paid in the case of the discharge of any seaman,
he shall be accountable to the United States for the full amount
thereof. The master shall provide any seaman so discharged with
employment on a vessel agreed to by the seaman, or shall provide
him with one month's extra wages, if it shall be shown to the satisfaction
of the consul that such seaman was not discharged for neglect
of duty, incompetency, or injury incurred on the vessel. If the
seaman is discharged by voluntary consent before the consul, he shall
be entitled to his wages up to the time of his discharge, but not for
any further period. If the seaman is discharged on account of injury
or illness, incapacitating him for service, the expenses of his maintenance
and return to the United States shall be paid from the fund
for the maintenance and transportation of destitute American
seamen: <i>Provided</i>, That at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce,
and under such regulations as he may prescribe, if any seaman
incapacitated from service by injury or illness is on board a vessel so
situated that a prompt discharge requiring the personal appearance of
the master of the vessel before an American consul or consular agent
is impracticable, such seaman may be sent to a consul or consular
agent, who shall care for him and defray the cost of his maintenance
and transportation, as provided in this paragraph. (R. S., 4581;
Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 16; Mar. 4, 1915; sec. 19.) (Effective beginning
Nov. 4, 1915.)</p>

<p>Whenever a vessel of the United States is sold in a foreign country
and her company discharged, it shall be the duty of the master to
produce to the consular officer a certified list of the ship's company,
and also the shipping articles, and besides paying to each seaman or
apprentice the wages due him, he shall either provide him with adequate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
employment on board some other vessel bound to the port at
which he was originally shipped, or to such other port as may be agreed
upon by him, or furnish the means of sending him to such port, or
provide him with a passage home, or deposit with the consular officer
such a sum of money as is by the officer deemed sufficient to defray
the expenses of his maintenance and passage home; and the
consular officer shall indorse upon the agreement with the crew of the
ship which the seaman or apprentice is leaving the particulars of
any payment, provision, or deposit made under this section. A failure
to comply with the provisions of this section shall render the
owner liable to a fine of not exceeding fifty dollars. (R. S., 4582,
Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 17.)</p>

<p>Whenever on the discharge of a seaman in a foreign country by a
consular officer on his complaint that the voyage is continued contrary
to agreement, or that the vessel is badly provisioned or unseaworthy,
or against the officers for cruel treatment, it shall be the duty
of the consul or consular agent to institute a proper inquiry into the
matter, and, upon his being satisfied of the truth and justice of such
complaint, he shall require the master to pay to such seaman one
month's wages over and above the wages due at the time of discharge,
and to provide him with adequate employment on board
some other vessel, or provide him with a passage on board some other
vessel bound to the port from which he was originally shipped,
or to the most convenient port of entry in the United States, or to
a port agreed to by the seaman. (R. S., 4583; Dec. 21, 1898;
sec. 18.)</p>

<h3>Wages.</h3>

<p>No seaman shall, by any agreement other than is provided by
this Title [R. S., 4501-4613], forfeit his lien upon the ship, or be deprived
of any remedy for the recovery of his wages to which he would
otherwise have been entitled; and every stipulation in any agreement
inconsistent with any provision of this Title, and every stipulation
by which any seaman consents to abandon his right to his
wages in the case of the loss of the ship, or to abandon any right
which he may have or obtain in the nature of salvage, shall be wholly
inoperative. (R. S., 4535.)</p>

<p>The following rules shall be observed with respect to the settlement
of wages:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
<i>First.</i> Upon the completion, before a shipping-commissioner, of
any discharge and settlement, the master or owner and each seaman,
respectively, in the presence of the shipping-commissioner, shall sign
a mutual release of all claims for wages in respect of the past voyage
or engagement, and the shipping-commissioner shall also sign and attest
it, and shall retain it in a book to be kept for that purpose, provided
both the master and seaman assent to such settlement, or the settlement
has been adjusted by the shipping-commissioner.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> Such release, so signed and attested, shall operate as a
mutual discharge and settlement of all demands for wages between the
parties thereto, on account of wages, in respect to the past voyage or
engagement.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> A copy of such release, certified under the hand and seal
of such shipping-commissioner to be a true copy, shall be given by him
to any party thereto requiring the same, and such copy shall be
receivable in evidence upon any future question touching such claims,
and shall have all the effect of the original of which it purports to
be a copy.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> In cases in which discharge and settlement before a
shipping-commissioner are required, no payment, receipt, settlement, or
discharge otherwise made shall operate as evidence of the release or
satisfaction of any claim.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> Upon payment being made by a master before a
shipping-commissioner, the shipping-commissioner shall, if required,
sign and give to such master a statement of the whole amount so paid;
and such statement shall, between the master and his employer, be
received as evidence that he has made the payments therein mentioned.
(R. S., 4552.)</p>

</div>

<p>Upon every discharge effected before a shipping-commissioner,
the master shall make and sign, in the form given in the table marked
"B," in the schedule annexed to this Title [R. S., 4501-4613], a
report of the conduct, character, and qualifications of the persons
discharged; or may state in such form, that he declines to give any
opinion upon such particulars, or upon any of them; and the commissioner
shall keep a register of the same, and shall, if desired so to
do by any seaman, give to him or indorse on his certificate of discharge
a copy of so much of such report as concerns him. (R. S.,
4553.)</p>

<p>A seaman's right to wages and provisions shall be taken to commence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
either at the time at which he commences work, or at the time
specified in the agreement for his commencement of work or presence
on board, whichever first happens. (R. S., 4524.)</p>

<p>No right to wages shall be dependent on the earning of freight
by the vessel; but every seaman or apprentice who would be entitled
to demand and receive any wages if the vessel on which he has
served had earned freight, shall, subject to all other rules of law and
conditions applicable to the case, be entitled to claim and recover
the same of the master or owner in personam, notwithstanding that
freight has not been earned. But in all cases of wreck or loss of
vessel, proof that any seaman or apprentice has not exerted himself
to the utmost to save the vessel, cargo, and stores, shall bar his
claim. (R. S., 4525.)</p>

<p>In cases where the service of any seaman terminates before the
period contemplated in the agreement, by reason of the loss or
wreck of the vessel, such seaman shall be entitled to wages for the
time of service prior to such termination, but not for any further
period. Such seaman shall be considered as a destitute seaman and
shall be treated and transported to port of shipment as provided
in sections forty-five hundred and seventy-seven, forty-five hundred
and seventy-eight, and forty-five hundred and seventy-nine of the
Revised Statutes of the United States. [This section shall not apply
to fishing or whaling vessels or yachts—Dec. 21, 1898, sec. 26.]
(R. S., 4526; Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 3.)</p>

<p>Any seaman who has signed an agreement and is afterward discharged
before the commencement of the voyage or before one
month's wages are earned, without fault on his part justifying such
discharge, and without his consent, shall be entitled to receive from
the master or owner, in addition to any wages he may have earned,
a sum equal in amount to one month's wages as compensation, and
may, on adducing evidence satisfactory to the court hearing the
case, of having been improperly discharged, recover such compensation
as if it were wages duly earned. (R. S., 4527.)</p>

<p>No seaman or apprentice shall be entitled to wages for any period
during which he unlawfully refuses or neglects to work when required,
after the time fixed by the agreement for him to begin work,
nor, unless the court hearing the case otherwise directs, for any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
period during which he is lawfully imprisoned for any offense committed
by him. (R. S., 4528.)</p>

<p>The master or owner or any vessel making coasting voyages shall
pay to every seaman his wages within two days after the termination
of the agreement under which he was shipped, or at the time such
seaman is discharged, whichever first happens; and in case of vessels
making foreign voyages, or from a port on the Atlantic to a port
on the Pacific, or vice versa, within twenty-four hours after the cargo
has been discharged, or within four days after the seaman has been discharged,
whichever first happens; and in all cases the seaman shall
be entitled to be paid at the time of his discharge on account of wages
a sum equal to one-third part of the balance due him. Every master
or owner who refuses or neglects to make payment in the manner
hereinbefore mentioned without sufficient cause shall pay to the seaman
a sum equal to two days' pay for each and every day during
which payment is delayed beyond the respective periods, which
sum shall be recoverable as wages in any claim made before the court;
but this section shall not apply to masters or owners of any vessel
the seamen of which are entitled to share in the profits of the cruise
or voyage. [This section shall not apply to fishing or whaling
vessels or yachts—Dec. 21, 1898, sec. 26—but this section shall
apply to all vessels engaged in the taking of oysters—June 28, 1906,
sec. 4.] (R. S. 4529; Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 4; June 28, 1906; sec. 4.
Mar. 4, 1915; sec. 3.) (Effective beginning Nov. 4, 1915.)</p>

<p>Every seaman on a vessel of the United States shall be entitled
to receive on demand from the master of the vessel to which he belongs
one-half part of the wages which he shall have then earned at every
port where such vessel, after the voyage has been commenced, shall
load or deliver cargo before the voyage is ended and all stipulations
in the contract to the contrary shall be void: <i>Provided</i>, Such a demand
shall not be made before the expiration of, nor oftener than once in
five days. Any failure on the part of the master to comply with
this demand shall release the seaman from his contract and he shall
be entitled to full payment of wages earned. And when the voyage
is ended every such seaman shall be entitled to the remainder of the
wages which shall then be due him, as provided in section forty-five
hundred and twenty-nine of the Revised Statutes: <i>Provided
further</i>, That notwithstanding any release signed by any seaman
under section forty-five hundred and fifty-two of the Revised Statutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
any court having jurisdiction may upon good cause shown set aside
such release and take such action as justice shall require: <i>And provided
further</i>, That this section shall apply to seamen on foreign
vessels while in harbors of the United States, and the courts of the
United States shall be open to such seamen for its enforcement.
[This section shall not apply to fishing or whaling vessels or yachts—Dec.
21, 1898, sec. 26.] (R. S., 4530; Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 5;
Mar. 4, 1915, sec. 4.) (Effective on American vessels beginning
Nov. 4, 1915; on vessels of foreign nations not covered by treaties
Mar. 4, 1916; on vessels of other foreign nations after termination
of treaties.)</p>

<p>Whenever the wages of any seaman are not paid within ten days
after the time when the same ought to be paid according to the provisions
of this Title [R. S., 4501-4613], or any dispute arises between
the master and seamen touching wages, the district judge for the
judicial district where the vessel is, or in case his residence be more
than three miles from the place, or he be absent from the place
of his residence, then, any judge or justice of the peace, or any
commissioner of a district court, may summon the master of such
vessel to appear before him, to show cause why process should not
issue against such vessel, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, according
to the course of admiralty courts, to answer for the wages. (R.
S., 4546; May 28, 1896.)</p>

<p>If the master against whom such summons is issued neglects
to appear, or, appearing, does not show that the wages are paid or
otherwise satisfied or forfeited, and if the matter in dispute is not
forthwith settled, the judge or justice or commissioner shall certify
to the clerk of the district court that there is sufficient cause of complaint
whereon to found admiralty process; and thereupon the
clerk of such court shall issue process against the vessel. In all cases
where the matter in demand does not exceed one hundred dollars
the return day of the monition or citation shall be the first day of a
stated or special session of court next succeeding the third day after
the service of the monition or citation, and on the return of process
in open court, duly served, either party may proceed therein to proofs
and hearing without other notice, and final judgment shall be given
according to the usual course of admiralty courts in such cases. In
such suits all the seamen having cause of complaint of the like kind
against the same vessel may be joined as complainants, and it shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
be incumbent on the master to produce the contract and log book,
if required to ascertain any matter in dispute; otherwise the complainants
shall be permitted to state the contents thereof, and the
burden of proof of the contrary shall be on the master. But nothing
herein contained shall prevent any seaman from maintaining any
action at common law for the recovery of his wages, or having immediate
process out of any court having admiralty jurisdiction wherever
any vessel may be found, in case she shall have left the port of delivery
where her voyage ended before payment of the wages, or in case she
shall be about to proceed to sea before the end of the ten days next
after the day when such wages are due, in accordance with section
forty-five hundred and twenty-nine of the Revised Statutes. [This
section shall not apply to fishing or whaling vessels or yachts—Dec.
21, 1898, sec. 26—but this section shall apply to all vessels
engaged in the taking of oysters—June 28, 1906, sec. 4.] (R. S.,
4547; Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 6; June 28, 1906; sec. 4.)</p>

<p>Moneys paid under the laws of the United States, by direction of
consular officers or agents, at any foreign port or place, as wages,
extra or otherwise, due American seamen, shall be paid in gold or
its equivalent, without any deduction whatever any contract to the
contrary notwithstanding. (R. S., 4548.)</p>

<p>Any question concerning the forfeiture of, or deductions from,
the wages of any seaman or apprentice, may be determined in any
proceeding lawfully instituted with respect to such wages, notwithstanding
the offense in respect of which such question arises, though
hereby made punishable by imprisonment as well as forfeiture, has
not been made the subject of any criminal proceeding. (R. S.,
4603.)</p>

<p>Whenever in any proceeding relating to seamen's wages it is shown
that any seaman or apprentice has, in the course of the voyage, been
convicted of any offense by any competent tribunal, and rightfully
punished therefor, by imprisonment or otherwise, the court
hearing the case may direct a part of the wages due to such seaman
not exceeding fifteen dollars, to be applied in reimbursing any costs
properly incurred by the master in procuring such conviction and
punishment. (R. S., 4605.)</p>

<h3>Advances and allotments of wages.</h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) It shall be, and is hereby, made unlawful in any case to pay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
any seaman wages in advance of the time when he has actually earned the
same, or to pay such advance wages, or to make any order, or note, or
other evidence of indebtedness therefor to any other person, or to pay
any person, for the shipment of seamen when payment is deducted or to
be deducted from a seaman's wages. Any person violating any of the
foregoing provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not
less than $25 nor more than $100, and may also be imprisoned for a
period of not exceeding six months, at the discretion of the court. The
payment of such advance wages or allotment shall in no case except as
herein provided absolve the vessel or the master or the owner thereof
from the full payment of wages after the same shall have been actually
earned, and shall be no defense to a libel suit or action of the
recovery of such wages. If any person shall demand or receive, either
directly or indirectly, from any seaman or other person seeking
employment, as seaman, or from any person on his behalf, any
remuneration whatever for providing him with employment, he shall for
every such offense be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
imprisoned not more than six months or fined not more than $500.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) It shall be lawful for any seaman to stipulate in his
shipping agreement for an allotment of any portion of the wages he may
earn to his grandparents, parents, wife, sister, or children.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) No allotment shall be valid unless in writing and signed by
and approved by the shipping-commissioner. It shall be the duty of the
said commissioner to examine such allotments and the parties to them
and enforce compliance with the law. All stipulations for the allotment
of any part of the wages of a seaman during his absence which are made
at the commencement of the voyage shall be inserted in the agreement
and shall state the amounts and times of the payments to be made and
the persons to whom the payments are to be made.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) No allotment except as provided for in this section shall be
lawful. Any person who shall falsely claim to be such relation, as
above described, of a seaman under this section shall for every such
offense be punished by a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not
exceeding six months, at the discretion of the court.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) This section shall apply as well to foreign vessels while in
waters of the United States, as to vessels of the United States, and
any master, owner, consignee, or agent of any foreign vessel who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
has violated its provisions shall be liable to the same penalty that
the master, owner, or agent of a vessel of the United States would be
for similar violation.</p>

<p>The master, owner, consignee, or agent of any vessel of the United
States, or of any foreign vessel seeking clearance from a port of the
United States, shall present his shipping articles at the office of
clearance, and no clearance shall be granted any such vessel unless the
provisions of this section have been complied with.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Under the direction of the Secretary of Commerce the
Commissioner of Navigation shall make regulations to carry out this
section. [This section shall not apply to fishing or whaling vessels or
yachts—Dec. 21, 1898, sec. 26—but this section shall apply to all
vessels engaged in the taking of oysters—June 28, 1906, sec. 4.] (Dec.
21, 1898; sec. 24; Apr. 26, 1904; June 28, 1906; sec. 4; Mar. 4, 1915;
sec. 11.) (Effective on American vessels beginning Nov. 4, 1915; on
vessels of foreign nations not covered by treaties Mar. 4, 1916; on
vessels of other foreign nations after termination of treaties.)</p>

<h3>Wages and clothing exempt from attachment.</h3>

<p>No wages due or accruing to any seaman or apprentice shall be
subject to attachment or arrestment from any court, and every payment
of wages to a seaman or apprentice shall be valid in law, notwithstanding
any previous sale or assignment of wages or of any
attachment, encumbrance, or arrestment thereon; and no assignment
or sale of wages or of salvage made prior to the accruing thereof
shall bind the party making the same, except such allotments as are
authorized by this title. This section shall apply to fishermen employed
on fishing vessels as well as to seamen: <i>Provided</i>, That nothing
contained in this or any preceding section shall interfere with the
order by any court regarding the payment by any seaman of any
part of his wages for the support and maintenance of his wife and
minor children. (Mar. 4, 1915; sec. 12.) (Effective beginning Nov.
4, 1915.)</p>

<p>The clothing of any seaman shall be exempt from attachment,
and any person who shall detain such clothing when demanded
by the owner shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be
imprisoned not more than six months or fined not more than five
hundred dollars, or both. (Feb. 18, 1895; Apr. 11, 1904.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
No sum exceeding one dollar shall be recoverable from any seaman,
by any one person, for any debt contracted during the time such
seaman shall actually belong to any vessel, until the voyage for which
such seaman engaged shall be ended. (R. S., 4537.)</p>

<h3>Desertion of seamen abroad.</h3>

<p>It shall be the duty of all consular officers to discountenance
insubordination by every means in their power and, where the local
authorities can be usefully employed for that purpose, to lend their
aid and use their exertions to that end in the most effectual manner.
In all cases where seamen or officers are accused, the consular officer
shall inquire into the facts and proceed as provided in section forty-five
hundred and eighty-three of the Revised Statutes; and the officer
discharging such seaman shall enter upon the crew list and shipping
articles and official log the cause of such discharge and the particulars
in which the cruel or unusual treatment consisted and subscribe his
name thereto officially. He shall read the entry made in the official
log to the master, and his reply thereto, if any, shall likewise be
entered and subscribed in the same manner. (R. S., 4600; Dec. 21,
1898; sec. 21; Mar. 4, 1915; sec. 8.) (Effective beginning Nov. 4,
1915.)</p>

<h3>Desertion of foreign seamen in the United States.</h3>

<p>On application of a consul or vice-consul of any foreign government
having a treaty with the United States stipulating for the restoration
of seamen deserting, made in writing, stating that the person
therein named has deserted from a vessel of any such government,
while in any port of the United States, and on proof by the exhibition
of the register of the vessel, ship's roll, or other official document,
that the person named belonged, at the time of desertion, to the crew
of such vessel, it shall be the duty of any court, judge, commissioner
of any circuit court, justice, or other magistrate, having competent
power, to issue warrants to cause such person to be arrested for
examination. If, on examination, the facts stated are found to be
true, the person arrested not being a citizen of the United States,
shall be delivered up to the consul or vice-consul, to be sent back to
the dominions of any such government, or, on the request and at the
expense of the consul or vice-consul, shall be detained until the consul
or vice-consul finds an opportunity to send him back to the
dominions of any such government. No person so arrested shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
detained more than two months after his arrest; but at the end of
that time shall be set at liberty, and shall not be again molested for
the same cause. If any such deserter shall be found to have committed
any crime or offense, his surrender may be delayed until
the tribunal before which the case shall be depending, or may be
cognizable, shall have pronounced its sentence, and such sentence
shall have been carried into effect. (R. S., 5280.)</p>

<h3>Repeal of treaties and conventions.</h3>

<p>In the judgment of Congress articles in treaties and conventions
of the United States, in so far as they provide for the arrest and
imprisonment of officers and seamen deserting or charged with desertion
from merchant vessels of the United States in foreign countries,
and for the arrest and imprisonment of officers and seamen
deserting or charged with desertion from merchant vessels of foreign
nations in the United States and the Territories and possessions
thereof, and for the cooperation, aid, and protection of competent
legal authorities in effecting such arrest or imprisonment and any
other treaty provision in conflict with the provisions of this Act,
ought to be terminated, and to this end the President be, and he is
hereby, requested and directed, within ninety days after the passage
of this Act, to give notice to the several Governments, respectively,
that so much as hereinbefore described of all such treaties and conventions
between the United States and foreign Governments will
terminate on the expiration of such periods after notices have been
given as may be required in such treaties and conventions. (Mar. 4,
1915; sec. 16.)</p>

<p>Upon the expiration after notice of the periods required, respectively,
by said treaties and conventions and of one year in the case
of the independent State of the Kongo, so much as hereinbefore
described in each and every one of said articles shall be deemed
and held to have expired and to be of no force and effect, and thereupon
section fifty-two hundred and eighty and so much of section
four thousand and eighty-one of the Revised Statutes as relates to
the arrest or imprisonment of officers and seamen deserting or charged
with desertion from merchant vessels of foreign nations in the United
States and Territories and possessions thereof, and for the cooperation,
aid, and protection of competent legal authorities in effecting
such arrest or imprisonment, shall be, and is hereby, repealed.
(Sec. 17.)</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></div>

<h3>Arbitration before shipping commissioner.</h3>

<p>Every shipping-commissioner shall hear and decide any question
whatsoever between a master, consignee, agent, or owner, and any
of his crew, which both parties agree in writing to submit to him;
and every award so made by him shall be binding on both parties,
and shall, in any legal proceedings which may be taken in the matter,
before any court of justice, be deemed to be conclusive as to the rights
of parties. And any document under the hand and official seal of a
commissioner purporting to be such submission or award, shall be
prima-facie evidence thereof. (R. S., 4554; Aug. 19, 1890.)</p>

<p>In any proceeding relating to the wages, claims, or discharge of
a seaman, carried on before any shipping-commissioner, under the
provisions of this Title [R. S., 4501-4613], such shipping-commissioner
may call upon the owner, or his agent, or upon the master, or any
mate, or any other member of the crew, to produce any log-books,
papers, or other documents in their possession or power, respectively,
relating to any matter in question in such proceedings, and may call
before him and examine any of such persons, being then at or near
the place, on any such matter; and every owner, agent, master, mate,
or other member of the crew who, when called upon by the shipping-commissioner,
does not produce any such books, papers, or documents,
if in his possession or power, or does not appear and give evidence,
shall, unless he shows some reasonable cause for such a default, be
liable to a penalty of not more than one hundred dollars for each
offense; and, on application made by the shipping-commissioner, shall
be further punished, in the discretion of the court, as in other cases
of contempt of the process of the court. (R. S., 4555.)</p>

<h3>Soliciting lodgers.</h3>

<p>If, within twenty-four hours after the arrival of any vessel at any
port in the United States, any person, then being on board such vessel,
solicits any seaman to become a lodger at the house of any person letting
lodgings for hire, or takes out of such vessel any effects of any
seaman, except under his personal direction, and with the permission
of the master, he shall, for every such offense, be punishable
by a fine of not more than fifty dollars, or by imprisonment for not
more than three months. This section shall apply to vessels of the
United States engaged in the foreign trade and to foreign vessels.
(R. S., 4607; Apr. 13, 1904.)</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></div>

<h3>Return of seamen from foreign ports, Alaska, and insular ports.</h3>

<p>It shall be the duty of the consuls, vice-consuls, commercial
agents, and vice-commercial agents, from time to time, to provide
for the seamen of the United States, who may be found destitute
within their districts, respectively, sufficient subsistence and passages
to some port in the United States, in the most reasonable manner, at
the expense of the United States, subject to such instructions as
the Secretary of State shall give. The seamen shall, if able, be bound
to do duty on board the vessels in which they may be transported,
according to their several abilities. (R. S., 4577.)</p>

<p>Relief and protection of American seamen in foreign countries, and
shipwrecked American seamen in the Territory of Alaska, in the Hawaiian
Islands, Porto Rico, the Panama Canal Zone, and the Philippine Islands,
$20,000. (Mar. 4, 1915.)</p>

<p>All masters of vessels of the United States, and bound to some
port of the same, are required to take such destitute seamen on board
their vessels, at the request of consular officers, and to transport
them to the port in the United States to which such vessel may be
bound, on such terms, not exceeding ten dollars for each person for
voyages of not more than thirty days, and not exceeding twenty
dollars for each person for longer voyages, as may be agreed between
the master and the consular officer, when the transportation is by a
sailing vessel; and the regular steerage passenger rate not to exceed
two cents per mile when the transportation is by steamer; and said
consular officer shall issue certificates for such transportation, which
certificates shall be assignable for collection. If any such destitute
seaman is so disabled or ill as to be unable to perform duty, the
consular officer shall so certify in the certificate of transportation,
and such additional compensation shall be paid as the Comptroller of
the Treasury shall deem proper. Every such master who refuses
to receive and transport such seamen on the request or order of
such consular officer shall be liable to the United States in a penalty
of one hundred dollars for each seaman so refused. The certificate
of any such consular officer, given under his hand and official seal,
shall be presumptive evidence of such refusal in any court of law having
jurisdiction for the recovery of the penalty. No master of any vessel
shall, however, be obliged to take a greater number than one man to
every one hundred tons burden of the vessel on any one voyage, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
to take any seaman having a contagious disease. (R. S., 4578;
June 26, 1884; sec. 9; June 19, 1886; sec. 18.)</p>

<p>Whenever distressed seamen of the United States are transported
from foreign ports where there is no consular officer of the United
States, to ports of the United States, there shall be allowed to the master
or owner of each vessel, in which they are transported, such
reasonable compensation, in addition to the allowance now fixed by
law, as shall be deemed equitable by the Comptroller of the Treasury.
(R. S., 4579.)</p>

<h3>Effects of deceased seamen.</h3>

<p>Whenever any seaman or apprentice belonging to or sent home
on any merchant vessel, whether a foreign-going or domestic vessel,
employed on a voyage which is to terminate in the United States,
dies during such voyage, the master shall take charge of all moneys,
clothes, and effects which he leaves on board, and shall, if he thinks
fit, cause all or any of such clothes and effects to be sold by auction
at the mast or other public auction, and shall thereupon sign an entry
in the official log-book, and cause it to be attested by the mate and
one of the crew, containing the following particulars:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> A statement of the amount of money so left by the deceased.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> In case of a sale, a description of each article sold,
and the sum received for each.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> A statement of the sum due to deceased as wages, and the
total amount of deductions, if any, to be made therefrom. (R. S., 4538.)</p>

</div>

<p>In cases embraced by the preceding section, the following rules
shall be observed:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> If the vessel proceeds at once to any port in the United
States, the master shall, within forty-eight hours after his arrival,
deliver any such effects remaining unsold, and pay any money which he
has taken charge of, or received from such sale, and the balance of
wages due to the deceased, to the shipping-commissioner at the port of
destination in the United States.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> If the vessel touches and remains at some foreign port
before coming to any port in the United States, the master shall report
the case to the United States consular officer there, and shall give to
such officer any information he requires as to the destination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
of the vessel and probable length of the voyage; and such officer may,
if he considers it expedient so to do, require the effects, money, and
wages to be delivered and paid to him, and shall, upon such delivery
and payment, give to the master a receipt; and the master shall within
forty-eight hours after his arrival at his port of destination in the
United States produce the same to the shipping-commissioner there. Such
consular officer shall, in any such case, indorse and certify upon the
agreement with the crew the particulars with respect to such delivery
and payment.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> If the consular officer does not require such payment and
delivery to be made to him, the master shall take charge of the
effects, money, and wages, and shall, within forty-eight hours after
his arrival at his port of destination in the United States, deliver
and pay the same to the shipping-commissioner there.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> The master shall, in all cases in which any seaman or
apprentice dies during the voyage or engagement, give to such officer
or shipping-commissioner an account, in such form as they may
respectively require, of the effects, money, and wages so to be
delivered and paid; and no deductions claimed in such account shall be
allowed unless verified by an entry in the official log-book, if there
be any; and by such other vouchers, if any, as may be reasonably
required by the officer or shipping-commissioner to whom the account is
rendered.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> Upon due compliance with such of the provisions of this
section as relate to acts to be done at the port of destination in the
United States, the shipping-commissioner shall grant to the master a
certificate to that effect. No officer of customs shall clear any
foreign-going vessel without the production of such certificate. (R.
S., 4539.)</p>

</div>

<p>Whenever any master fails to take such charge of the money or
other effects of a seaman or apprentice during a voyage, or to make
such entries in respect thereof, or to procure such attestation to such
entries, or to make such payment or delivery of any money, wages,
or effects of any seaman or apprentice dying during a voyage, or to
give such account in respect thereof as is above directed, he shall be
accountable for the money, wages, and effects of the seaman or
apprentice to the district court in whose jurisdiction such port of
destination is situate, and shall pay and deliver the same accordingly;
and he shall, in addition, for every such offense, be liable to a penalty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
of not more than treble the value of the money or effects, or, if such
value is not ascertained, not more than two hundred dollars; and
if any such money, wages, or effects are not duly paid, delivered
and accounted for by the master, the owner of the vessel shall pay,
deliver, and account for the same, and such money and wages and
the value of such effects shall be recoverable from him accordingly;
and if he fails to account for and pay the same, he shall, in addition
to his liability for the money and value, be liable to the same penalty
which is incurred by the master for a like offense; and all money,
wages, and effects of any seaman or apprentice dying during a voyage
shall be recoverable in the courts and by the modes of proceeding
by which seaman are enabled to recover wages due to them. (R. S.,
4540.)</p>

<p>Whenever any such seaman or apprentice dies at any place out
of the United States, leaving any money or effects not on board of
his vessel, the consular officer of the United States at or nearest the
place shall claim and take charge of such money and effects, and shall,
if he thinks fit, sell all or any of such effects, or any effects of any
deceased seaman or apprentice delivered to him under the provisions
of this Title [R. S., 4501-4613], and shall quarterly remit
to the district court for the district embracing the port from which
such vessel sailed, or the port where the voyage terminates, all moneys
belonging to or arising from the sale of the effects or paid as the wages
of any deceased seamen or apprentices which have come to his
hands; and shall render such accounts thereof as the circuit court
requires. (R. S., 4541; Mar. 3, 1897; sec. 4.)</p>

<p>Whenever any seaman or apprentice dies in the United States,
and is, at the time of his death, entitled to claim from the master
or owner of any vessel in which he has served, any unpaid wages
or effects, such master or owner shall pay and deliver, or account for
the same, to the shipping-commissioner at the port where the seaman
or apprentice was discharged, or was to have been discharged, or
where he died. (R. S., 4542; Mar. 3, 1897; sec. 6.)</p>

<p>Every shipping-commissioner in the United States shall, within
one week from the date of receiving any such money, wages, or effects
of any deceased seaman or apprentice, pay, remit, or deliver to the
district court of the district in which he resides, the money, wages,
or effects, subject to such deductions as may be allowed by the district
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
court for expenses incurred in respect to such money and effects;
and should any commissioner fail to pay, remit, and deliver the same
to the district court, within the time hereinbefore mentioned, he shall
incur a penalty of not more than treble the value of such money and
effects. (R. S., 4543.)</p>

<p>If the money and effects of any seaman or apprentice paid,
remitted, or delivered to the district court, including the moneys
received for any part of his effects which have been sold, either before
delivery to the district court, or by its directions, do not exceed in
value the sum of three hundred dollars, then, subject to the provisions
hereinafter contained, and to all such deductions for expenses incurred
in respect to the seaman or apprentice, or of his money and
effects, as the said court thinks fit to allow, the court may pay and
deliver the said money and effects to any claimants who can prove
themselves either to be his widow or children, or to be entitled to
the effects of the deceased under his will, or under any statute, or at
common law, or to be entitled to procure probate, or take out letters
of administration or confirmation, although no probate or letters of
administration or confirmation have been taken out, and shall be
thereby discharged from all further liability in respect of the money
and effects so paid and delivered; or may, if he thinks fit so to do,
require probate, or letters of administration or confirmation, to be
taken out, and thereupon pay and deliver the said money and effects
to the legal personal representatives of the deceased; and if such
money and effects exceed in value the sum of three hundred dollars,
then, subject to deduction for expenses, the court shall pay and
deliver the same to the legal personal representatives of the deceased.
(R. S., 4544.)</p>

<p>A district court, in its discretion, may at any time direct the sale
of the whole or any part of the effects of a deceased seaman or apprentice,
which it has received or may hereafter receive, and shall hold
the proceeds of such sale as the wages of deceased seamen are held.
When no claim to the wages or effects or proceeds of the sale of the
effects of a deceased seaman or apprentice, received by a district
court, is substantiated within six years after the receipt thereof by
the court, it shall be in the absolute discretion of the court, if any subsequent
claim is made, either to allow or refuse the same. Such
courts shall, from time to time, pay any moneys arising from the unclaimed
wages and effects of deceased seamen, which in their opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
it is not necessary to retain for the purpose of satisfying claims,
into the Treasury of the United States, and such moneys shall form
a fund for, and be appropriated to, the relief of sick and disabled
and destitute seamen belonging to the United States merchant marine
service. (R. S., 4545; Mar. 3, 1897; sec. 7.)</p>

<h3>Sick and disabled seamen.</h3>

<p>The President is authorized to receive donations of real or personal
property, in the name of the United States, for the erection or
support of hospitals for sick and disabled seamen. (R. S., 4801.)</p>

<p>The term "seaman," wherever employed in legislation relating
to the marine-hospital service, shall be held to include any person
employed on board in the care, preservation, or navigation of any
vessel, or in the service, on board, of those engaged in such care,
preservation, or navigation. (Mar. 3, 1875; sec. 3.)</p>

<p>No person employed in or connected with the navigation, management,
or use of canal-boats engaged in the coasting-trade shall
by reason thereof be entitled to any benefit or relief from the marine-hospital
fund. (R. S., 4804.)</p>

<p>Sick and disabled seamen of foreign vessels and of vessels [not
subject to hospital-dues] may be cared for by the marine-hospital
service at such rates and under such regulations as the Secretary of
the Treasury may prescribe. (Mar. 3, 1875; sec. 6.)</p>

<p>Sick foreign seamen may be admitted to the marine hospitals
within the United States, if it can with convenience be done, on the
application of the master of any foreign vessel to which any such
seaman may belong. Each seaman so admitted shall be subject
to a charge of [seventy-five cents] per day for each day he may remain
in the hospital, which shall be paid by the master of such foreign
vessel to the collector of the collection-district in which such hospital
is situated. And the collector shall not grant a clearance to any
foreign vessel until the money so due from her master shall be paid.
The officer in charge of each hospital is hereby directed, under penalty
of fifty dollars, to make out the accounts against each foreign
seaman that may be placed in the hospital under his direction, and
render the same to the collector. (R. S., 4805; Mar. 3, 1875;
sec. 6.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
Insane patients of said [marine hospital] service shall be admitted
into the Government Hospital for the Insane upon the order of the
Secretary of the Treasury, and shall be cared for therein until cured
or until removed by the same authority; and the charge for each such
patient shall not exceed four dollars and fifty cents a week, which
charge shall be paid out of the marine-hospital fund. (Mar. 3, 1875;
sec. 5.)</p>

<p>The privilege of admission to and temporary treatment in the
marine hospitals under the control of the Government of the United
States be, and is hereby, extended to the keepers and crews of the
Life-Saving Service under the same rules and regulations as those
governing sailors and seamen, and for the purposes of this Act members
of the Life-Saving Service shall be received in said hospitals
and treated therein, and at the dispensaries thereof, as are seamen
of American registered vessels; but this Act shall not be so construed
as to compel the establishment of hospitals or dispensaries
for the benefit of said keepers and crews, nor as establishing a home
for the same when permanently disabled. (Aug. 4, 1894.)</p>

<h3>Jurisdiction over American seamen in foreign ports and foreign
seamen in American ports.</h3>

<p>Whenever it is stipulated by treaty or convention between the
United States and any foreign nation that the consul-general, consuls,
vice-consuls, or consular or commercial agents of each nation,
shall have exclusive jurisdiction of controversies, difficulties, or disorders
arising at sea or in the waters or ports of the other nation,
between the master or officers and any of the crew, or between
any of the crew themselves, of any vessel belonging to the nation
represented by such consular officer, such stipulations shall be executed
and enforced within the jurisdiction of the United States
as hereinafter declared. But before this section shall take effect
as to the vessels of any particular nation having such treaty with the
United States, the President shall be satisfied that similar provisions
have been made for the execution of such treaty by the other
contracting party, and shall issue his proclamation to that effect,
declaring this section to be in force as to such nation. (R. S., 4079.)</p>

<p>In all cases within the purview of the preceding section the consul-general,
consul, or other consular or commercial authority of such
foreign nation charged with the appropriate duty in the particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
case, may make application to any court of record of the United
States, or to any judge thereof, or to any commissioner of a district
court, setting forth that such controversy, difficulty, or disorder has
arisen, briefly stating the nature thereof, and when and where the
same occurred, and exhibiting a certified copy or abstract of the shipping-articles,
roll, or other proper paper of the vessel, to the effect
that the person in question is of the crew or ship's company of such
vessel; and further stating and certifying that such person has
withdrawn himself, or is believed to be about to withdraw himself,
from the control and discipline of the master and officers of the vessel,
or that he has refused, or is about to refuse, to submit to and obey
the lawful jurisdiction of such consular or commercial authority
in the premises; and further stating and certifying that, to the
best of the knowledge and belief of the officer certifying, such person
is not a citizen of the United States. Such application shall be in
writing and duly authenticated by the consular or other sufficient
official seal. Thereupon such court, judge, or commissioner shall
issue his warrant for the arrest of the person so complained of, directed
to the marshal of the United States for the appropriate district,
or in his discretion to any person, being a citizen of the United
States, whom he may specially depute for the purpose, requiring
such person to be brought before him for examination at a certain
time and place. (R. S., 4080; May 28, 1896.)</p>

<p>If, on such examination, it is made to appear that the person so
arrested is a citizen of the United States, he shall be forthwith discharged
from arrest, and shall be left to the ordinary course of law.
But if this is not made to appear, and such court, judge, or commissioner
finds, upon the papers hereinbefore referred to, a sufficient
prima-facie case that the matter concerns only the internal order
and discipline of such foreign vessels, or, whether in its nature civil
or criminal, does not affect directly the execution of the laws of the
United States, or the rights and duties of any citizen of the United
States, he shall forthwith, by his warrant, commit such person to
prison, where prisoners under sentence of a court of the United
States may be lawfully committed, or, in his discretion, to the
master or chief officer of such foreign vessel, to be subject to the lawful
orders, control, and discipline of such master or chief officer, and
to the jurisdiction of the consular or commercial authority of the
nation to which such vessel belongs, to the exclusion of any authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
or jurisdiction in the premises of the United States or any State
thereof. No person shall be detained more than two months after
his arrest, but at the end of that time shall be set at liberty and shall
not again be arrested for the same cause. The expenses of the arrest
and the detention of the person so arrested shall be paid by the
consular officer making the application. (R. S., 4081.) (See
R. S., 5280 as amended Mar. 4, 1915.)</p>

<p>The district courts, and the United States commissioners, shall
have power to carry into effect, according to the true intent and meaning
thereof, the award, or arbitration, or decree of any consul, vice-consul,
or commercial agent of any foreign nation, made or rendered
by virtue of authority conferred on him as such consul, vice-consul,
or commercial agent, to sit as judge or arbitrator in such differences
as may arise between the captains and crews of the vessels belonging
to the nation whose interests are committed to his charge, application
for the exercise of such power being first made to such court or
commissioner by petition of such consul, vice-consul, or commercial
agent. And said courts and commissioners may issue all proper
remedial process, mesne and final, to carry into full effect such award,
arbitration, or decree, and to enforce obedience thereto, by imprisonment
in the jail or other place of confinement in the district in which
the United States may lawfully imprison any person arrested under
the authority of the United States, until such award, arbitration, or
decree is complied with, or the parties are otherwise discharged therefrom,
by the consent in writing of such consul, vice-consul, or commercial
agent, or his successor in office, or by the authority of the
foreign government appointing such consul, vice-consul, or commercial
agent: <i>Provided, however</i>, That the expenses of the said imprisonment,
and maintenance of the prisoners, and the cost of the proceedings,
shall be borne by such foreign government, or by its consul,
vice-consul, or commercial agent requiring such imprisonment. The
marshals of the United States shall serve all such process, and do all
other acts necessary and proper to carry into effect the premises,
under the authority of the said courts and commissioners. (R. S.,
728; Mar. 3, 1911; sec. 271.)</p>

<h3>Seamen's witness fees.</h3>

<p>There shall be paid to each seaman or other person who is sent
to the United States from any foreign port, station, sea, or ocean,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
by any United States minister, chargé d'affaires, consul, captain, or
commander, to give testimony in any criminal case depending in
any court of the United States, such compensation, exclusive of subsistence
and transportation, as such court may adjudge to be proper,
not exceeding one dollar for each day necessarily employed in such
voyage, and in arriving at the place of examination or trial. In
fixing such compensation, the court shall take into consideration the
condition of said seaman or witness, and whether his voyage has been
broken up, to his injury, by his being sent to the United States.
When such seaman or person is transported in an armed vessel of
the United States no charge for subsistence or transportation shall
be allowed. When he is transported in any other vessel, the compensation
for his transportation and subsistence, not exceeding in any
case fifty cents a day, may be fixed by the court, and shall be paid
to the captain of said vessel accordingly. (R. S. 851.)</p>

<h3>Manning of merchant vessels.</h3>

<p>In all merchant vessels of the United States of more than one
hundred tons gross, excepting those navigating rivers, harbors, bays,
or sounds exclusively, the sailors shall, while at sea, be divided into
at least two, and the firemen, oilers, and water tenders into at least
three watches, which shall be kept on duty successively for the
performance of ordinary work incident to the sailing and management
of the vessel. The seamen shall not be shipped to work
alternately in the fireroom and on deck, nor shall those shipped for
deck duty be required to work in the fireroom, or vice versa; but
these provisions shall not limit either the authority of the master
or other officer or the obedience of the seamen when, in the judgment
of the master or other officer, the whole or any part of the crew are
needed for the maneuvering of the vessel or the performance of work
necessary for the safety of the vessel or her cargo, or for the saving
of life aboard other vessels in jeopardy, or when in port or at sea
from requiring the whole or any part of the crew to participate in the
performance of fire, lifeboat, and other drills. While such vessel
is in a safe harbor no seaman shall be required to do any unnecessary
work on Sundays or the following-named days: New Year's Day,
the Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas
Day, but this shall not prevent the dispatch of a vessel on regular
schedule or when ready to proceed on her voyage. And at all times
while such vessel is in a safe harbor, nine hours, inclusive of the anchor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
watch, shall constitute a day's work. Whenever the master of any
vessel shall fail to comply with this section, the seamen shall be
entitled to discharge from such vessel and to receive the wages earned.
But this section shall not apply to fishing or whaling vessels, or yachts.
(Mar. 4, 1915; sec. 2.) (Effective beginning Nov. 4, 1915.)</p>

<p>No vessel of one hundred tons gross and upward, except those
navigating rivers exclusively and the smaller inland lakes and except
as provided in section one of this Act, shall be permitted to depart
from any port of the United States unless she has on board a crew not
less than seventy-five per centum of which, in each department
thereof, are able to understand any order given by the officers of such
vessel, nor unless forty per centum in the first year, forty-five per
centum in the second year, fifty per centum in the third year, fifty-five
per centum in the fourth year after the passage of this Act, and
thereafter sixty-five per centum of her deck crew, exclusive of licensed
officers and apprentices, are of a rating not less than able seaman.
Every person shall be rated an able seaman, and qualified for service
as such on the seas, who is nineteen years of age or upward, and
has had at least three years' service on deck at sea or on the Great
Lakes, on a vessel or vessels to which this section applies, including
decked fishing vessels, naval vessels or coast guard vessels; and every
person shall be rated an able seaman, and qualified to serve as such
on the Great Lakes and on the smaller lakes, bays or sounds, who is
nineteen years of age or upward and has had at least eighteen months'
service on deck at sea or on the Great Lakes or on the smaller lakes,
bays, or sounds, on a vessel or vessels to which this section applies,
including decked fishing vessels, naval vessels, or coast guard vessels;
and graduates of school ships approved by and conducted under
rules prescribed by the Secretary of Commerce may be rated able
seamen after twelve months' service at sea: <i>Provided</i>, That upon examination,
under rules prescribed by the Department of Commerce
as to eyesight, hearing, and physical condition, such persons or
graduates are found to be competent: <i>Provided further</i>, That upon
examination, under rules prescribed by the Department of Commerce
as to eyesight, hearing, physical condition, and knowledge of the
duties of seamanship a person found competent may be rated as able
seaman after having served on deck twelve months at sea, or on the
Great Lakes; but seamen examined and rated able seamen under
this proviso shall not in any case compose more than one-fourth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
the number of able seamen required by this section to be shipped
or employed upon any vessel.</p>

<p>Any person may make application to any board of local inspectors
for a certificate of service as able seaman, and upon proof being made
to said board by affidavit and examination, under rules approved by
the Secretary of Commerce, showing the nationality and age of the
applicant and the vessel or vessels on which he has had service
and that he is entitled to such certificate under the provisions of
this section, the board of local inspectors shall issue to said applicant
a certificate of service, which shall be retained by him and be accepted
as prima facie evidence of his rating as an able seaman.</p>

<p>Each board of local inspectors shall keep a complete record of
all certificates of service issued by them and to whom issued and
shall keep on file the affidavits upon which said certificates are
issued.</p>

<p>The collector of customs may, upon his own motion, and shall,
upon the sworn information of any reputable citizen of the United
States setting forth that this section is not being complied with
cause a muster of the crew of any vessel to be made to determine
the fact; and no clearance shall be given to any vessel failing to
comply with the provisions of this section: <i>Provided</i>, That the collector
of customs shall not be required to cause such muster of the
crew to be made unless said sworn information has been filed with
him for at least six hours before the vessel departs, or is scheduled
to depart: <i>Provided further</i>, That any person that shall knowingly
make a false affidavit for such purpose shall be deemed guilty of perjury
and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not
exceeding $500 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by
both such fine and imprisonment, within the discretion of the court.
Any violation of any provision of this section by the owner, master,
or officer in charge of the vessel shall subject the owner of such vessel
to a penalty of not less than $100 and not more than $500: <i>And
provided further</i>, That the Secretary of Commerce shall make such
rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions
of this section, and nothing herein shall be held or construed to prevent
the Board of Supervising Inspectors, with the approval of the
Secretary of Commerce, from making rules and regulations authorized
by law as to vessels excluded from the operation of this section.
(Mar. 4, 1915; sec. 13.) (Effective on American vessels beginning
Nov. 4, 1915; on vessels of foreign nations not covered by treaties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
Mar. 4, 1916; on vessels of other foreign nations after termination
of treaties.)</p>

<h3>Undermanning.</h3>

<p>In case of desertion or casualty resulting in the loss of one or more
of the seamen, the master must ship, if obtainable, a number equal
to the number of those whose services he has been deprived of by
desertion or casualty, who must be of the same or higher grade or
rating with those whose places they fill, and report the same to the
United States consul at the first port at which he shall arrive, without
incurring the penalty prescribed by the two preceding sections.
This section shall not apply to fishing or whaling vessels or yachts.
(R. S., 4516; Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 1; Mar. 4, 1915; sec. 1.) (Effective
beginning Nov. 4, 1915.)</p>

<h3>Fellow-servant clause.</h3>

<p>In any suit to recover damages for any injury sustained on board
vessel or in its service seamen having command shall not be held to
be fellow-servants with those under their authority. (Mar. 4, 1915;
sec. 20.) (Effective beginning Nov. 4, 1915.)</p>

<h3>Unseaworthy vessels.</h3>

<p>If any person knowingly sends or attempts to send or is party to
the sending or attempting to send an American ship to sea, in the
foreign or coastwise trade, in such an unseaworthy state that the life
of any person is likely to be thereby endangered, he shall, in respect
of each offense, be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished
by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars or by imprisonment not
to exceed five years, or both, at the discretion of the court, unless he
proves that either he used all reasonable means to insure her being
sent to sea in a seaworthy state, or that her going to sea in an unseaworthy
state was, under circumstances, reasonable and justifiable,
and for the purposes of giving that proof he may give evidence in
the same manner as any other witness. [This section shall not apply
to fishing or whaling vessels or yachts.—Dec. 21, 1898, sec. 26; Dec.
21, 1898; sec. 11.]</p>

national interest in the case of vessels engaged in any trade, the owner

personal injury from war risks as well as for compensation during
detention by an enemy of the United States following capture.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />
DISCIPLINE AT SEA</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Authority</span>, to some minds, means oppression and injustice;
people so constituted should stay ashore; a ship has no
use for them—they simply cannot get along.</p>

<p>The orderly man lives his life aboard ship with the greatest
freedom.</p>

<p>Discipline at sea is largely a matter of common sense.
Officers who know their business have very little trouble in
achieving perfect discipline. The laws governing lack of
ability bear hard on the man who has shipped to do work
he is not qualified for. The disturber has a hard time when
handled by a Master who knows the law and his authority.</p>

<p>The laws relating to offenses on board ship are appended,
not as guide to crime, but to inform the seaman of the fact
that the flag and the laws of the land follow the ship out
beyond the three-mile limit.</p>

<p>Some officers have a way with them that carries along
the work of the vessel without friction and with the utmost
amount of dispatch. These officers know their business
thoroughly. They are absolutely just, which means that
the slacker and malingerer are given the full brunt of disapproval.
The "coming down" on a loafer, good and hard,
helps more to bring forth respect for an officer than anything
else. When this is coupled by even-handed justice, and a
human way of doing things, such as looking out for the comfort
of their men, a happy vessel is bound to be the result.</p>

<p>Seamen like nothing better than to know that they are
under officers who will run things on the level. It is like
being under a decent government that helps the weak and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
curbs the strong—there is a fascination to running things
right that merchant officers should cultivate.</p>

<p>Below are the punishments meted out to those that believe
in individual license, and who think that the individual can
do as he pleases without consulting the rest of us. They
are wrong, of course, but most of all, <b>they are most often,
simply ignorant</b>.</p>

<h4>Offenses and punishments.</h4>

<p>Whenever any seaman who has been lawfully engaged or any
apprentice to the sea service commits any of the following offenses,
he shall be punished as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> For desertion, by forfeiture of all or any part of the
clothes or effects he leaves on board and of all or any part of the
wages or emoluments which he has then earned.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> For neglecting or refusing without reasonable cause to
join his vessel or to proceed to sea in his vessel, or for absence
without leave at any time within twenty-four hours of the vessel's
sailing from any port, either at the commencement or during the
progress of the voyage, or for absence at any time without leave and
without sufficient reason from his vessel and from his duty, not
amounting to desertion, by forfeiture from his wages of not more than
two days' pay or sufficient to defray any expenses which shall have
been properly incurred in hiring a substitute.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> For quitting the vessel without leave, after her arrival
at the port of her delivery and before she is placed in security, by
forfeiture from his wages of not more than one month's pay.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> For willful disobedience to any lawful command at sea,
by being, at the option of the master, placed in irons until such
disobedience shall cease, and upon arrival in port by forfeiture from
his wages of not more than four days' pay, or, at the discretion of the
court, by imprisonment for not more than one month.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> For continued willful disobedience to lawful command or
continued willful neglect of duty at sea, by being, at the option of
the master, placed in irons, on bread and water, with full rations
every fifth day, until such disobedience shall cease, and upon arrival
in port by forfeiture, for every twenty-four hours' continuance of such
disobedience or neglect, of a sum of not more than twelve days' <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
pay, or by imprisonment for not more than three months, at the
discretion of the court.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i> For assaulting any master or mate, by imprisonment for
not more than two years.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i> For willfully damaging the vessel, or embezzling or
willfully damaging any of the stores or cargo, by forfeiture out of his
wages of a sum equal in amount to the loss thereby sustained, and also,
at the discretion of the court, by imprisonment for not more than
twelve months.</p>

<p><i>Eighth.</i> For any act of smuggling for which he is convicted and
whereby loss or damage is occasioned to the master or owner, he shall
be liable to pay such master or owner such a sum as is sufficient to
reimburse the master or owner for such loss or damage, and the whole or
any part of his wages may be retained in satisfaction or on account of
such liability, and he shall be liable to imprisonment for a period of
not more than twelve months. (R. S., 4596; Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 19; Mar.
4, 1915; sec. 7.) (Effective beginning Nov. 4, 1915.)</p>

</div>

<p>Upon the commission of any of the offenses enumerated in the
preceding section an entry thereof shall be made in the official log
book on the day on which the offense was committed, and shall be
signed by the master and by the mate or one of the crew; and the
offender, if still in the vessel, shall, before her next arrival at any
port, or, if she is at the time in port, before her departure therefrom,
be furnished with a copy of such entry, and have the same read over
distinctly and audibly to him, and may thereupon make such a reply
thereto as he thinks fit; and a statement that a copy of the entry
has been so furnished, or the same has been so read over, together
with his reply, if any, made by the offender, shall likewise be entered
and signed in the same manner. In any subsequent legal proceedings
the entries hereinbefore required shall, if practicable, be produced
or proved, and in default of such production of proof the court
hearing the case may, at its discretion, refuse to receive evidence of
the offense. (R. S., 4597; Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 20.)</p>

<p>All clothes, effects, and wages which, under the provisions of this
Title [R. S., 4501-4613], are forfeited for desertion, shall be applied,
in the first instance, in payment of the expenses occasioned by such
desertion, to the master or owner of the vessel from which the desertion
has taken place, and the balance, if any, shall be paid by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
master or owner to any shipping-commissioner resident at the port
at which the voyage of such vessel terminates; and the shipping-commissioner
shall account for and pay over such balance to the judge
of the district court within one month after the commissioner receives
the same, to be disposed of by him in the same manner as is prescribed
for the disposal of the money, effects, and wages of deceased
seamen. Whenever any master or owner neglects or refuses to pay
over to the shipping-commissioner such balance, he shall be liable
to a penalty of double the amount thereof, recoverable by the commissioner
in the same manner that seamen's wages are recovered.
In all other cases of forfeiture of wages, the forfeiture shall be for
the benefit of the master or owner by whom the wages are payable.
(R. S., 4604.)</p>

<p>Any master of, or any seaman or apprentice belonging to, any
merchant vessel, who, by willful breach of duty, or by reason of drunkenness,
does any act tending to the immediate loss or destruction
of, or serious damage to such vessel, or tending immediately to endanger
the life or limb of any person belonging to or on board of such
vessel; or who, by willful breach of duty, or by neglect of duty, or
by reason of drunkenness, refuses or omits to do any lawful act proper
and requisite to be done by him for preserving such vessel from immediate
loss, destruction, or serious damage, or for preserving any
person belonging to or on board of such ship from immediate danger
to life or limb, shall, for every such offense, be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than twelve
months. (R. S., 4602.)</p>

<h4>Sheath knives not allowed.</h4>

<p>No seaman in the merchant-service shall wear any sheath-knife on
shipboard. It shall be the duty of the master of any vessel registered,
enrolled, or licensed under the laws of the United States, and
of the person entering into contract for the employment of a seaman
upon any such vessel, to inform every person offering to ship himself
of the provisions of this section, and to require his compliance therewith,
under a penalty of fifty dollars for each omission, to be sued
for and recovered in the name of the United States, under the direction
of the Secretary of Commerce; one half for the benefit of the
informer, and the other half for the benefit of the fund for the relief
of sick and disabled seamen. (R. S. 4608; Feb. 14, 1903; sec. 10.)</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></div>

<h4>Corporal punishment prohibited.</h4>

<p>Flogging and all other forms of corporal punishment are hereby
prohibited on board of any vessel, and no form of corporal punishment
on board of any vessel shall be deemed justifiable, and any
master or other officer thereof who shall violate the aforesaid provisions
of this section, or either thereof, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not less than three
months nor more than two years. Whenever any officer other than
the master of such vessel shall violate any provision of this section,
it shall be the duty of such master to surrender such officer to the
proper authorities as soon as practicable, provided he has actual
knowledge of the misdemeanor, or complaint thereof is made within
three days after reaching port. Any failure on the part of such
master to use due diligence to comply herewith, which failure shall
result in the escape of such officer, shall render the master or vessel
or the owner of the vessel liable in damages for such flogging or corporal
punishment to the person illegally punished by such officer.
(R. S., 4611; Dec. 21, 1898; sec. 22; Mar. 4, 1915; sec. 9.) (Effective
beginning Nov. 4, 1915.)</p>

<h4>Procedure.</h4>

<p>All penalties and forfeitures imposed by this Title [R. S., 4501-4613],
for the recovery whereof no specific mode is hereinbefore provided,
may be recovered, with costs, in any district court of the
United States, at the suit of any district attorney of the United States,
or at the suit of any person by information to any district attorney
in any port of the United States, where or near to where the offense is
committed or the offender is found; and if a conviction is had, and
the sum imposed as a penalty by the court is not paid either immediately
after the conviction, or within such period as the court at the
time of the conviction appoints, it shall be lawful for the court to
commit the offender to prison, there to be imprisoned for the term
hereinbefore provided in case of such offense, the commitment to be
terminable upon payment of the amount and costs; and all penalties
and forfeitures mentioned in this Title for which no special application
is provided, shall, when recovered, be paid and applied in
manner following: So much as the court shall determine, and the
residue shall be paid to the court and be remitted from time to time,
by order of the judge, to the Treasury of the United States, and
appropriated as provided for in section forty-five hundred and fortyfive:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
<i>Provided always</i>, That it shall be lawful for the court before
which any proceeding shall be instituted for the recovery of any
pecuniary penalty imposed by this act, to mitigate or reduce such
penalty as to such court shall appear just and reasonable; but no
such penalty shall be reduced to less than one-third of its original
amount: <i>Provided also</i>, That all proceedings so to be instituted shall
be commenced within two years next after the commission of the
offense, if the same shall have been committed at or beyond the
Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn, or within one year if committed
elsewhere, or within two months after the return of the offender and
the complaining party to the United States; and there shall be no
appeal from any decision of any of the district courts, unless the
amount sued for exceeds the sum of five hundred dollars. (R. S.,
4610.)</p>

<h3 class="center">CRIMES</h3>

<h4>Place of trial.</h4>

<p>The trial of all offenses committed upon the high seas or elsewhere,
out of the jurisdiction of any particular State or district, shall
be in the district where the offender is found, or into which he is first
brought.</p>

<p>When any offense against the United States is begun in one
judicial district and completed in another, it shall be deemed to have
been committed in either, and may be dealt with, inquired of, tried,
determined, and punished in either district, in the same manner as
if it had been actually and wholly committed therein.</p>

<p>All pecuniary penalties and forfeitures may be used for and
recovered either in the district where they accrue or in the district
where the offender is found.</p>

<p>The crimes and offenses defined in this chapter shall be punished
as herein prescribed:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p><i>First.</i> When committed upon the high seas, or on any other waters
within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and
out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, or when committed
within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and
out of the jurisdiction of any particular State on board any vessel
belonging in whole or in part to the United States or any citizen

<h2>APPENDIX B<br />
THE SEA LIBRARY</h2>

<div class="app-b">

<p>The books an officer should have, <i>and study</i>, are appended.</p>

<h3>Bowditch's American Practical Navigator.</h3>

<p>The Navigator's Bible.</p>

<h3>Lecky's Wrinkles in Practical Navigation.</h3>

<p>No comment needed. An officer who does not know this book—well,
 he is simply not all there as an officer.</p>

<h3>Bradford's Whys and Wherefores of Navigation.</h3>

<p>An American book, of intimate and interesting information on the
 subject of navigation. If you want to know "why," own and study
 Bradford, it is a book for the man who likes to thoroughly understand
 his subject—simple, clear, complete.</p>

<h3>Jacoby's Navigation.</h3>

<p>A good book for the beginner.</p>

<h3>Knight's Seamanship.</h3>

<p>The best American work on seamanship, naval and merchant service. The
 chapters on ship handling and the higher problems of seamanship are
 exceptionally good.</p>

<h3>Todd and Whall's Seamanship.</h3>

<p>The best book to date for the merchantman.</p>

<h3>Walton's Know Your Own Ship.</h3>

<p>Information about vessels that every officer aboard ship should
 possess.</p>

<h3>White's Oil Tank Steamers.</h3>

<p>An excellent work by an officer who knows his subject.</p>

<h3>Allingham's Weather Signs and How to Read Them.</h3>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
